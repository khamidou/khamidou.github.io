title: How to set up vim autocompletion for python programming

I've recently had to use eclipse for Java development and I liked a lot the autocomplete feature. I've decided to try to get something similar in Vim for python programming, but unfortunately the steps to get there are a bit convoluted. I've decided to list them here.

The first thing to do is to set up omnicompletion for python files. Omnicompletion uses the context of the current phrase to guess the text to complete.

{% highlight vim %}
autocmd FileType python set omnifunc=pythoncomplete#Complete
{% endhighlight %}

(Vim has a number of custom completion functions for every language. For instance, my .vimrc contains the following lines : )

{% highlight vim %}

autocmd FileType javascript set omnifunc=javascriptcomplete#CompleteJS
autocmd FileType html set omnifunc=htmlcomplete#CompleteTags
autocmd FileType css set omnifunc=csscomplete#CompleteCSS
autocmd FileType xml set omnifunc=xmlcomplete#CompleteTags
autocmd FileType php set omnifunc=phpcomplete#CompletePHP
autocmd FileType c set omnifunc=ccomplete#Complete

{% endhighlight %}
