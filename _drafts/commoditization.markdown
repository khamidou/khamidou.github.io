Two things.

1. The first time I automated a deployment using fabric, I just felt like I beat the system or something. I still get a little shiver when I get to deploy new code with my script. It's funny because I've almost lost the knowledge of how to do it by hand. In essence, I've made myself redundant for a specific set of tasks. More than that, setting up a server used to be the job of the sysadmin. Now, a lot of programmers get do this themselves, because of devops.

2. This isn't only the case for programmers and sysadmins, designers have the same problem. [You can pick up a professional looking theme for about 20$](http://themeforest.net/). At this point, the value of a good designer lies more into how they can inform a project and less into making things pretty. And the breadth of the things you have to know as a modern designer is frightening: you've got to understand design, typography, grids, HTML/CSS, accessibility, Information Architecture.

Where do we go from now?
