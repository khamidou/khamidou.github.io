More than ten years ago, Joel Spolsky wrote a great post about [how software implementation details influence online communities](www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/BuildingCommunitieswithSo.html). 

One tidbit caught my eye: here's how Joel's forum signals to the user if there are replies to a topic. It's really smart!

> Q. Why don't you have some kind of system so I can see what posts I've already read?

> A. We have the best system that can be implemented in a distributed, scalable fashion: we let everyone's browser keep track of it. Web browsers will change the color of the links you've already visited from blue to purple. So all we have to do is subtly change the URL for each topic to include the number of replies available; that way when there are additional replies the post will appear in the "unread" color again.

The rest of the article is also very interesting.
