Let's try something a little different. I've always loved picking apart great sales pages to see what makes them tick.

Snappy is a customer support webapp. It targets small to medium-sized companies.

# Introduction

This is the first thing you see about snappy. The design is quite minimalist, but there are links to all the important pages, including my favorite one, the login page.[^loginpage]

The tagline is clear and direct. There's even a testimonial from one of their customers, and his picture. That's always reassuring to see Snappy is used by real persons. The quote could be a little better though:

_"Snappy allows us to get rid of all of the problems of email"_. Sure, but what problems exactly does it solve? Email has a lot of problems.[^abtests]

The next screen shows a small screenshot of Snappy followed by four paragraphs of sales text. It's a _very good idea_ to tease us with this image before getting to the wall of text.

The role of this part is making us realize we have a support email problem. It tells us a story, which is the most important thing in sales page. The story itself is great --- I found myself nodding twice at it[^unread] --- and the outline is very clear (which is great for skimmers!).

However, there's a couple things which could be better.

First, what's with the very long sentences? _"Do you remember the first time you answered a paying customerâ€™s email, quickly and courteously, with joy and even honor at the opportunity to solve a problem, delivering exactly the solution they needed, right when they needed it?"_ This is just confusing.

Second, and this is very subjective, but the parts could flow a little better together. I especially feel like part two and three could be merged together.

The next part is _brillant_! Most sales pages would jump straight to the presentation of the product. The snappy guys chose to feature an awesome customer testimonial. **"We ain't going back"**. This is gold!

## Benefits

We get to the meat of the page with a long list of benefits Snappy brings.

[^loginpage]: You'd be surprised by the number of webapps that forget this.
[^abtests]: Of course, they've probably A/B tested this quote to death, but still.

    I also have a very personal nitpick: there's no link to Grant's company. I understand the rationale --- you don't want people to leave your sales page before you've had the time to pitch them. It's annoying for compulsive readers like me though (arguably a very small part of the population).

[^unread]: Especially the bit about marking emails as unread. I do this all the time!
