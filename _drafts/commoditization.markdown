title: The melancholy of the modern programmer

Lately I've been thinking about what it means to be a programmer today. If, like I do, you write webapps, you're probably using open source code. And even if you don't, you're probably working on making a FOO component talk to a BAR object using the QUUX protocol.[^replace]

One day FOO and BAR got a communication breakdown and you've been scouring stackoverflow ever since. I know this is not what I signed up for when I started programming. This looks more like LEGO than programming, actually[^our-jobs]

Sadly, we've got rich people problems. Our processors have gotten some powerful we can afford to run expensive servers using very high level language which make it easy to write O(n^3) algorithms without realizing it. We've got so much memory we can afford to write high-level code so disconnected from reality that we you 

The role of open source in this
There's a melancholy -- you feel like a lot of this is moving bits from one place to another
In reality it holds tremendous value. This is the duct tapes which holds together the global economy

There's something I'd like someone else to have told me when I started. Most software is only 80% done. It's a fact of life. 

[^replace]: Replace FOO with COM+, BAR with MFC and QUUX with ATL -- or something else altogether, it depends of your chapel.
[^our-jobs]: That's why I don't believe programmers are ever going to be replaced. Who would want to spend their time debugging tons of mission-critical spaghetti code? We've got the ultimate job security: not a lot of people like debugging.
