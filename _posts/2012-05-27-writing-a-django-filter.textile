title: Writing a django filter

h1. {{ page.title }}

p(meta). 27 May 2012

I recently had to implement a django filter. My problem was that I had an event page similar to the github feed. I wanted to format a date diferently whether the event occured in the current week or at another date. Instead of doing it in code or in the template (bad), I decided to write a filter for that. You can grab the code "here":{{site_url}}/static/filters.py

h3. Directory structure

Django expects to find the filters and template tag for an application in a specific directory, _templatetags_. 
You'll have to create this directory if it doesn't already exist and to add inside it an empty __init__.py file so that python treats the folder as a module.

After that, create a file named "filters.py". It will hold our new filter. Add the following code in it.
