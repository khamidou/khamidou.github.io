title: Endless Choices

Last year I interned at Microsoft to work on Xbox Music, a streaming app similar to Spotify. On my first day on the job, I received a free one year Xbox Music pass. Of course, I started to [dogfood](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogfooding) the service at home (after all, it's the idea behind dogfooding).

Three months in I realized that I was listening to music differently with Xbox Music.
I had access to millions of songs, but I was staying in the little sphere of artists I knew of. I was almost feeling overwhelmed.

I think it's because there's so much choice that it becomes mentally taxing. 

Whenever I'm on the frontpage of Xbox Music or Spotify, I'm wondering "What should I do? Listen to something I already know? Or maybe check out this trending album?". I usually end up listening to an album I've already heard thousand of times.

In the presence of too much choice, the brain defaults to what it already knows.

Do you remember this?

Winamp was a great piece of software. I also remember when me and my friends in middle school switched to iTunes. We switched mostly because our libraries where getting bigger and Winamp's simple file selector just didn't cut it. When you have more than a hundred albums you need to have an abstraction like the library.

The idea behind the library is to forget about the layout of files on the filesystem. Instead, put everything at the same place, add 
album covers and god will recognize his own.

(Eventually, Winamp introduced a library feature but by then we had moved on).


Now, with the streaming services with moved to another order of magnitude. The size of our library was limited by the size of our (already gigantic) disks. 
But how do you handle millions of tracks? Spotify and Xbox Music think we still want playlists of songs, just like Winamp had in 2001. 

I'm not sure it's what everybody wants anymore. Playlists are curated. They had to when you were going to burn one to a CD; you were limited to 25-30 tracks. Now, with so much music to listen to, habit types seem to have shifted to something a lot more passive; "I just want to put some music in the background while I'm working" is something you hear a lot.

So there's a shift to use sophisticated algorithms to suggest music you might like.

Now this has me worried about the future of music consumption. Since Napster, music has become a commodity. The majors fought against it tooth and nail. Now, increasingly desperate, they've decided to authorize streaming provider to stream music. But I'm not seeing
