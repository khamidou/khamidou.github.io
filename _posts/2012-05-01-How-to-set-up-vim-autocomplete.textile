I've recently had to use eclipse for Java development and I liked a lot the autocomplete feature. I've decided to try to get something similar in Vim, but unfortunately the steps to get there are a bit convoluted. I've decided to list them here.

The first thing to do is to set up omnicompletion, like this:

{% highlight python %}
    def f():
        pass
{% endhighlight %}
