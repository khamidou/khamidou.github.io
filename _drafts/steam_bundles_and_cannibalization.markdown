title: Steam, Humble Bundles and Cannibalization
---

For the longest time, I've wondered if Humble Bundles and Steam were hurting or helping the video games industry. 
There's not a lot of data about this on the Internet but some indie gamemakers were kind enough to share some numbers on their blogs.

- Jason Rohrer, explained in a [post](http://thecastledoctrine.net/seedBlogs.php?action=display_post&post_id=jasonrohrer_1389812989_0&show_author=1&show_date=1) why he was refusing to participate to Steam Sales.

- The creators of Dustforce Hitbox Team, did a [year in review](http://hitboxteam.com/dustforce-sales-figures) post. Dustforce was featured in the Indie Bundle 6. 

- PocketWatch Games, whose game Monaco was in last month's Indie Bundle 11 wrote a [postmortem](http://blog.pocketwatchgames.com/post/78594124321/humble-bundle-post-mortem-750k-monacos-sold).

A warning: this post is mostly going to be some wild speculation, with a few facts peppered here and there.

In his post, Jason makes two good points. First, steams sales and bundles have created a culture of permanent sales. Second, the way longtail video games are priced in digital stores is wrong.

#### A culture of permanent sales

First, the facts. There's [65 million steam users](http://store.steampowered.com/news/12396/). The humble indie bundle 6 sold 316,272 copies and the humble bundle 11, 493,000. It's probably hard to imagine this in the Internet Echo Chamber, but bundle buyers are a tiny portion of steam users. Steam probably makes the equivalent revenue of a bundle everyday.

(As a sidenote, this is market segmentation at work. Why does steam let the humble store resell steam keys? Because they target a different segment than the Steam Store.)

But, are bundles are bundles hurting the revenues of whom who need them the most, the indies?

And this is the one for Gary's mod

Now, one of Jason's points is that Gary's mod could have enjoyed the long and steady growth it has without resorting to sales. I don't think he's right. Games are a hit driven industry. Classically, a game will have huge sale numbers at its release, and those numbers will become dwindling as it fades from the public consciousness.

I'm not saying you should screw your fans, just that they're not a lot. 

**Key takeaway: You should screw off your fans if you want to make it.**
