title: RSS and Mailing Lists
---

Just a quick thought. RSS is very obviously in a bad shape. Mailing lists on the other hand are as good as ever. 

<!-- more -->

There's two reasons for this:

- RSS got its lunch eaten by alternatives who offered more (Facebook/Twitter/Reddit). Why waste time checking your RSS reader when you've already most of it on twitter?
- Second, mailing lists are set and forget. You've only got to check your inbox from time to time, which you probably already do. 


There's one takeaway:

__People are busy. If you want them to use your app, make it 'set and forget'.__ 

By the way, email is a great way to do this because it doesn't require people to think of your app. 
There's not a whole lot of apps out there who use it in a meaningful way.
