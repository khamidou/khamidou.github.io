title: The structure of a longform sales page
---
Call me weird but I've always loved reading longform sales pages. I guess I just like the way they lead the reader to the sale. 
I've read through a few ebooks landing page for ebooks, notably by programmers and, well, it's a kind of mixed bag.

There's a thing I've noticed again and again: ebooks written by programmers have [extremely](http://createyourproglang.com/) [short](http://www.jstorimer.com/products/working-with-unix-processes) [landing](http://exceptionalruby.com/) [pages](https://www.petekeen.net/mastering-modern-payments). I think it's because we programmers generally don't like to brag. We'd like our products to stand on their own merits. It's a delusion though.

Here's an excerpt from the landing page of [the Ultimate Guide to Disneyworld](http://dw-secrets.com). It's an ebook written for middle-aged stay-at-home moms, and it's a great landing page. Here's how the author sells one of the many chapters of it's book (highlighting is mine):

On the other hand, here's how [Working with unix processes](http://www.jstorimer.com/products/working-with-unix-processes) sells itself[^pick].

Of course the subject is deeply technical, but I'm sure people would have benefitted from a little more hand-holding. So, there's four different ways to exit a process, how does it matter to me? There's real world concerns about spawning shell commands, ok, why not be more specific? What if this paragraph was rewritten like this:

__The real world concerns of spawning shell commands and how to avoid them__

Recognize it, everyone has done this from time to time.

**Key takeaway: Study the work of the greats. Read more longform copy.**
