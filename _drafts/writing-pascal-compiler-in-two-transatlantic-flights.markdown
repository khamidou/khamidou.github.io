title: How to write a Pascal compiler in (roughly) two transatlantic flights
featured: true

I'm a french software engineer who lives in SF. I go roughly twice a year back to my native France.
I've always wanted to write a compiler so I decided to do it during one of those long, boring 11 hour flights between SFO and CDG.

Why pascal? I know. It's weird but I wanted to try an exotic language.

## Magical Mystery Tour
## Writing a lexer

The tooling for pascal is pretty fun.

## Parsing and code generation
