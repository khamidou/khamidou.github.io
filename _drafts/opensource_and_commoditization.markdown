There's an idiom in French for articles magazines publish every year, at the same time. They're called "chestnut trees"[^maronniers]. I used to read the Linux journal from time to time, and they had an issue they did every January, like clockwork: "200x: the year of the Linux desktop".

Don't you find it funny that Linux never took off on the desktop?

I remember that in the early-to-mid 2000's there was some unbriddled optimism about open source. Microsoft was knee-deep in security holes[^remember], Apple was mostly making expensive computers and IBM was pouring billions into Linux. We were going to win!

What happened?

I think a lot of developers underestimate how much external factors matter when developing software. Marketing, community management are important things to get people to use your work. Open source project are developed by volunteers, on their spare time.

There's one demographic which doesn't care much about marketing and user interface: developers
Where did Linux took off? On the servers. Why? Because it provides a lot of glue code which isn't user-facing.

[^maronniers]: "maronniers".

[^compiz]: Do you remember Compiz and XGL? For a time it seemed like every distro needed to have its own 3D desktop switcher and  deformable windows.

[^remember]: Remember Win32.Blaster, Sasser and the rest? Looking back at this, it seems pretty impressive that they've turned around and now have a decent security record.
