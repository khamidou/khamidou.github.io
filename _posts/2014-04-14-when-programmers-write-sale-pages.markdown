title: When programmers write sales pages
---
Call me weird but I've always loved reading longform sales pages. Lately I've been reading through some programming ebooks sales pages and I've noticed a pattern again and again: every one of [them](http://createyourproglang.com/) [is](http://www.jstorimer.com/products/working-with-unix-processes) [extremely](http://exceptionalruby.com/) [short](https://www.petekeen.net/mastering-modern-payments). 

For example, here's how [Working with unix processes](http://www.jstorimer.com/products/working-with-unix-processes) sells itself[^pick].

Of course the subject is deeply technical, but I'm sure people would have benefited from a little more hand-holding. So, there are real world concerns about spawning shell commands, what are they?

On the other hand, Here's an excerpt from the landing page of [the Ultimate Guide to Disneyworld](http://dw-secrets.com). It's an ebook written for middle-aged stay-at-home moms, and it has a great landing page. Here's how the author sells one of the many chapters of the book (highlighting is mine):

See the difference? 
__The Disneyland ebook is a lot more upfront about the value it will bring out.__ 

Most programmers don't like to brag. We'd like our products to stand on their own merits. It's not a good idea to do this on your landing page, though.  There's a lot of potential readers out there who don't understand the problem enough to make an informed choice and they're also the ones who need your book the most. 
 
__Key takeaway: You shouldn't expect your customers to understand the value of your product by themselves.__

[^pick]: This is just an example; I've got nothing against Jesse Storimer. I actually think his intro text is really really well written. It's one of the best opening sentences I've ever read on a landing page. (Here it is, for the curious: 
    <blockquote>You're a web developer. A good one. You write Rails apps in your sleep. But you skipped over some fundamentals. You feel like your foundation is lacking. This book will fill that gap.</blockquote>
    It really speaks to me.)
