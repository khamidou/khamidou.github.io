Every social media website, from the big ones to the smaller ones (i.e: Pocket) have some sort of infinite feed that you can keep scrolling, basically forever. One of my 2018 resolutions is to spend a bit less time inside these "infinite pools".

Of course, I used this resolution as an excuse to play with the extension APIs for Chrome, Safari and Firefox, and ended up building an extension to hide the feeds from Facebook and Pocket. It's called "Infinite Pools" and you can look at the source on [Github](https://github.com/khamidou/infinity-pools) or get it for [Chrome](https://raw.github.com/khamidou/infinity-pools/master/InfinityPools.crx) and [Firefox](https://raw.github.com/khamidou/infinity-pools/master/infinity_pools-1.0-an%2Bfx.xpi).

We'll see how effective these are!
