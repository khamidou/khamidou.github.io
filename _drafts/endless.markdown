Last year I interned at Microsoft to work on Xbox Music, a streaming app similar to Spotify. On my first day on the job, I received a free one year Xbox Music pass. Of course, I started to [dogfood](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogfooding) the service at home.

After some time, I realized that even though I had access to millions of songs, I was staying in the little sphere of artists I knew of. I was almost feeling overwhelmed.

I think it's because there's so much choice that it becomes mentally taxing. 

Whenever I'm on the frontpage of Xbox Music or Spotify, I'm wondering "What should I do? Listen to something I already know? Or maybe check out this trending album?". I usually end up listening to an album I've already heard thousand of times.

It got me thinking, forgive me if I'm meandering too much. Also, this is also probably a retelling of the [Long Tail](http://www.amazon.com/The-Long-Tail-Business-Selling/dp/1401309666/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1392664147&sr=8-1&keywords=the+long+tail) and [A World Of Hits](http://www.economist.com/node/14959982), but, well, the best way to understand something is to explain it to someone else.

Do you remember this?

Winamp was a great piece of software. I also remember when my friends and me switched to iTunes. We did it mostly because our libraries were getting bigger and Winamp's simple file selector just didn't cut it. When you have more than a hundred albums you need to have an abstraction like the library.

The idea behind the library is to forget about the layout of files on the filesystem. Instead, put everything at the same place, add 
album covers and god will recognize his own.

(Eventually, Winamp introduced a library feature but by then we had moved on).


Now, with the streaming services with moved to another order of magnitude. The size of our library was limited by the size of our (already gigantic) disks. 
But how do you handle millions of tracks? We can't. So there's now a shift to use sophisticated algorithms to suggest music you might like.

The algorithms are now good enough for music has become a fungible good. It means you can mostly listen to the myriad of groups who sound like the white stripes instead of listening to the white stripes.

Now this is an interesting situation for the majors. They're sitting on these huge catalogs, and most tracks are dormant. They'd probably want to exploit parts of it &ndash; it costs money to keep those rights after all. So in a way, those algorithms are a godsend. But they're also a curse too. There's only so much garage rock you can listen to in a day. You may prefer say, Ty Segall to the white stripes.  
You see, the majors have a trick to get people to listen to artists. They promote them. 

So, the middle artists are going to suffer the most. Now the
