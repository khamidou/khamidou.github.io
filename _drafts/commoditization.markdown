title: Software and commoditization
---
The first time I automated a deployment using fabric, I just felt like I beat the system or something. The best thing is I don't have to remember the exact way to setup a server, since the details are stored in a version-controlled script.

This is software eating the world.

It took me some time to realize this because this sentence sounds so self-aggrandizing. As if software were this sort of litteral godzilla. Instead, small gains compound.

For instance, take a look at provisioning servers. For the longest time, it was something which took days. You had to talk to a sysadmin, maybe fill some form to register at a datacenter, and so on. Now you can get a server running in minutes with a provider like DigitalOcean or even OVH. How did we get to this? 

There's this huge network of opensource which conspires to bring software costs down.[^linuxdesktop]

Take for instance designers. Your average website doesn't need a rockstar designer.[^dev] Some savvy entrepreneurs recognized this and made websites to sell off-the-shelf themes. Voil√†, you don't need a designer. Some smart designers recognized this and decided to move up the food chain. They decided to be in charge of the whole user experience. Beats being seen as a pixel pusher any day.

We, developers, are seeing the same problem. 



In a moment of clarity, I just realize that nobody will sit up through the bullshit of having to debug a complex system. Ironically, the only thing which stands between us and commoditization is forty years of worse is better.

[^fabric]: Or more precisely while I wait for fabric or puppet to configure it.
[^dev]: Or for that matter developper.
[^linuxdesktop]: Since I've started using Linux, every tear has been the year of Linux on the desktop.
