title: Endless Choices
---
Last year I interned at Microsoft to work on Xbox Music, a streaming app similar to Spotify. On my first day on the job, I received a free one year Xbox Music pass. Of course, I started to also use the service at home (after all, it's the idea behind dogfooding).

Three months in I realized that I was slowly changing the way I listened to music.
I had access to millions of songs, but I was staying in the little sphere of artists I knew of. I was almost feeling overwhelmed.

I think it's because there's so much choice that it becomes mentally taxing. 

Whenever I'm on the frontpage of Xbox Music or Spotify, I'm wondering "What should I do? Listen to something I already know? Or maybe check out this trending album?". It just never ends.


### Search interfaces

In the presence of too much choice, the brain defaults to what it already knows.

Why? Because the UI is too _specific_. How many times do you ask yourself : "I'm going to listen to $SPECIFIC\_ARTIST"? Rather, the majority of people would like to put some music.
