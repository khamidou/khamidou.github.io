When I was at Microsoft I got to meet Steve Ballmer. He was doing some sort of farewell tour of the various Microsoft offices around the world. It was a strange moment, exhilirating and sad at the same time.

At the end of his speech there was a small Q&A session and someone asked Steve what he wished he had done during his tenure at Microsoft. My memory is hazy about his exact reply; but I remember his answer quickly derailed about how the future was about companies who understood software was going to integreate into online services. He added Google got this, but Apple didn't (yet).

For some reason I remembered this tidbit yesterday while reading [Brent Simmons' sync diaries](http://inessential.com/vespersyncdiary).

It's been an interesting read because Brent is primarily an iOS developer and it's funny to see him question some things we take for granted. Also, a sync system is probably one of the hardest things to get right.[^byzantine].

People have begun expecting this kind of functionality from apps. After all, if google does it,
