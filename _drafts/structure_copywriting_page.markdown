title: The structure of a longform sales page
---
Call me weird but I've always loved reading longform sales pages. I guess I just like the way they gently take me by the hand. After reading through a couple dozens, I found the best pages [all](http://www.dw-secrets.com/) [have](http://zerotolaunchsystem.com/about/) [the](http://www.jstorimer.com/products/working-with-unix-processes) (this one is not technically long but it shares the same ideas) [same]() [structure]().

When I was in high school, years ago, I used to study latin. I don't remember a lot from these days, but this one stuck with me: the action in a classical play follows three stages. It's always the case. Ancient greeks liked consistency above all. 

A good longform copy page follows mostly the same structure, except it's a lot less _dramatic_[^pun].

This structure is __Exposition__ __Tension__ __Resolution__

## Exposition!

The goal of this stage is make people realize they have a problem and that you, the writer, understand them.
The best sales pages tell a story about your reader and yourself.

Here's a couple examples. This one is from the [Ultimate Guide to Disney World Savings](http://dw-secrets.com).

Or this one, from the sales page of [Working with Unix Processes](http://www.jstorimer.com/products/working-with-unix-processes) (it's a really strong opener by the way. In five short sentences Jesse Storimer paints an accurate picture of the reader. I could see myself identifying with the person described).

## Tension!

In this part, the writer try to spark the enthusiasm of the reader. It makes sense to do so because ebooks are impulse buys.
There's a variety of ways to do this. The most common one is simply going over the benefits of the book, while detailing how much value they will bring out:

I don't want to single out anyone. It's just that we, programmers, are often to focused on features, and not enough on benefits.
I'm sure potential readers would have benefited having a little more hand-holding (

There's an optional part called objection handling which happens for the more costly products.

## Resolution!


**Key takeaway: Study the work of the greats. Read more longform copy.**

[^pun]: Pun intended.
[^cta_buttons]: If it's best to put a CTA button at the bottom, why do some page put them at the top? Simply because some buyers are returning visitors.
