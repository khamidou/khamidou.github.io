The one thing that shocked me the most when moving to San Francisco is how many homeless people there are. I had never seen before so many mentally ill people left to their own means.

I have the feeling that things have been getting worse lately. There are more people on the street, more tent campments and more break-ins. It turns out it pretty simple to confirm if this is the case or not â€“ we can just use the [street cleaning data](https://datasf.org/opendata/) the city of San Francisco makes available for free!

And if you're curious, he's a complete map of where people find needles in the city. Sounds like you should move to the Presidio if you want to avoid them.
