title: Steam, Humble Bundles and sales cannibalization
---

For the longest time, I've wondered if Humble Bundles and Steam were hurting or helping the video games industry. 
There's not a lot of data about this on the Internet but some indie gamemakers were kind enough to share some numbers on their blogs.

- Jason Rohrer, explained in a [post](http://thecastledoctrine.net/seedBlogs.php?action=display_post&post_id=jasonrohrer_1389812989_0&show_author=1&show_date=1) why he was refusing to participate to Steam Sales. He also gave a couple figures and graphs about his sales.

- The creators of Dustforce, Hitbox Team, did a [year in review](http://hitboxteam.com/dustforce-sales-figures) post. Dustforce was featured in the Humble Indie Bundle 6. It seems to have made a pretty okay year.

- PocketWatch Games &ndash; whose game Monaco was in last month's Humble Bundle &ndash; wrote a [postmortem](http://blog.pocketwatchgames.com/post/78594124321/humble-bundle-post-mortem-750k-monacos-sold).

**A warning**: this post is mostly going to be some wild speculation, with a few facts peppered here and there.

### What is this about?

In his post, Jason makes two points. 

1. Steam sales and bundles have created a culture of permanent sales. This causes people to skip on buying games when they first come out.
2. Longtail video games are priced the wrong way in digital stores. The price should increase over time (like Minecraft) instead of decreasing progressively (like most of the games).

I'll try to show quickly why I think he's wrong.

### The facts

There's [65 million steam users](http://store.steampowered.com/news/12396/). The humble indie bundle 6 sold 316,272 copies and the humble bundle 11, 493,000. It's probably hard to imagine this in the Internet Echo Chamber, but bundle buyers are a tiny portion of steam users. Steam probably makes the equivalent revenue of a bundle daily.[^1]

But are bundles and mega-sales hurting the revenues of whom who need them the most, the indies?

### The speculation

This is the sales graph for "Inside a Star-Filled Sky" (courtesy of Jason Rohrer). It's a pretty common curve type for a cultural product. Most sales occur during first few weeks. After this, they tapper off, as the game fades from the public consciousness. The spikes graph happen during steam sales.

And this is the one for Gary's mod ([courtesy of Garry Newman](https://twitter.com/garrynewman/status/180684499926007809)):

Now, one of Jason's points is that Gary's mod could have enjoyed the long and steady growth it has without resorting to sales. I don't think so, for two reasons.

1. Gary's mod is clearly an outlier. There's not a lot of indie games who've sold three million copies over their lifetime. 
2. The graph below is Dustforce's net income for 2012.

There's two interesting things in this graph. 

1. The curve has roughly the same slope before and after the Steam Midweek Madness. This means to me that the people who bought dustforce then weren't planning to get it. Of course, there could be some potential sales cannibalization, but since the sale was so short (only three days, and only brought 20 000 dollars, I doubt it was significant. They at most lost 4000 players).
2. It seems that just before the humble bundle the sales have almost tappered off. Again, this could be because of cannibalization, but this would be weird. If you look at the games that were included in past bundles, you can see they are old games. Among the games included with Dustforce were Torchlight (2009), Rochard (2011), Shatter (2009). I doubt any player waited for say, Torchlight to be included in the bundle to buy it. 

it's probably because the game had reached most of its public (more on this later). After the bundle, the sales went on the rise, so this means the bundle and the promotion behind it stimulated sales.

### Why there is no cannibalization

**Key takeaway: You should screw off your fans if you want to make it.**
