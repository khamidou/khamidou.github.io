title: Commoditization
---
During moments of downtime, like when I'm setting up a new server[^fabric], I wonder how will our profession evolve. I'm nagged by fears of seeing our jobs taken by the machines we so much loved to program. 

Take for instance designers. Your average website doesn't need a rockstar designer.[^dev] Some savvy entrepreneurs recognized this and made websites to sell off-the-shelf themes. Voil√†, you don't need a designer. Some smart designers recognized this and decided to move up the food chain. They decided to be in charge of the whole user experience. Beats being seen as a pixel pusher any day.

We, developers, are seeing the same problem. 



In a moment of clarity, I just realize that nobody will sit up through the bullshit of having to debug a complex system. Ironically, the only thing which stands between us and commoditization is forty years of worse is better.

[^fabric]: Or more precisely while I wait for fabric or puppet to configure it.
[^dev]: Or for that matter developper.
