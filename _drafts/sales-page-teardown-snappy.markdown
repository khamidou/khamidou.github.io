Let's try something a little different. I've always loved picking apart great sales pages to see what makes them tick.

[Snappy](https://besnappy.com/) is a customer support webapp which targets small to medium-sized companies. They have a great sales page which uses customer quotes really well.

## Introduction

<img src="/images/snappy_teardown/1.png" class="img-responsive" />

This is the first thing you see about snappy. The design is quite minimalist, but there are links to all the important pages, including my favorite one, the login page.[^loginpage]

The tagline is clear and direct. It's a good idea to have a customer testimonial from the get-go --- it's always reassuring to see an app is used by real persons. However, the quote itself is a little too non-specific for my taste:

_"Snappy allows us to get rid of all of the problems of email"_.

Sure, email has a lot of problems, but does Snappy solve mine? The role of the first screen is to make the reader read the rest of the page. Opening with a quote about a very specific problem of email support (e.g: the number of dropped support emails before and after snappy) would make the copy much more compelling.[^abtests]

## Story

The next screen shows a small screenshot of Snappy followed by four paragraphs of sales text. It's a _very good idea_ to tease us with this image before getting to the wall of text.

<img src="/images/snappy_teardown/4.png" class="img-responsive" />

The role of this part is to make the reader realize she has a support email problem. It tells a story, which is the most important thing in sales page. The story itself is good[^unread] --- and the outline is very clear (which is great for skimmers!). However, there's a couple things which could be better.

First, some sentences are way too long. _"Do you remember the first time you answered a paying customerâ€™s email, quickly and courteously, with joy and even honor at the opportunity to solve a problem, delivering exactly the solution they needed, right when they needed it?"_

Long and meandering sentences like this one run out of steam quickly. Shorter phrases are easier to grasp, and pack more punch. (In this case, I would rewrite the previous sentence like this: _"Do you remember the first time you answered a customer's email? How quickly you replied --- the joy you felt about solving their problem? Do you remember how thrilled they were to see their problem solved?"_)

Second, and this is very subjective, but the parts could flow a little better. In particular, I feel like part two and three could be merged together. They're about the same thing after all.

Still, these are minor complaints which could get smoothed out with a little editing.

The next part is _brillant_! Most sales pages would jump straight to the presentation of the product. The snappy guys chose to feature a great customer quote. **"We ain't going back"**. This is gold!

## Benefits

We get to the meat of the sales pitch with the long list of benefits Snappy brings. This is pretty much your standard list of benefits. Once again, I really like how the designers peppered customer testimonials to break the monotony.

<img src="/images/snappy_teardown/7.png" class="img-responsive" />
<img src="/images/snappy_teardown/8.png" class="img-responsive" />

Unfortunately they didn't follow their idea all the way through: they've got a great quote about how easy it is to set up Snappy, but it floats at the bottom of the page instead of supporting the main pitch:

## Pricing grid

The next section is the pricing grid. I really like how their design reminds the reader of the hidden costs of using Gmail for support. It's a great way to make choosing Snappy obvious.

One weird thing with this pricing model is that they're charging the same flat-rate per seat whatever the number of users. Surely the usefulness of Snappy increases with the number of support persons, which implies higher prices?[^gmailuse]

## Wrap-up

The page wraps things up quickly by presenting the team[^aboutpage], showing one last testimonial and suggesting taking the product tour.

It would be awesome to have a link to talk to support directly --- this a helpdesk solution after all. I looked at a few other helpdesk webapps[^saaswebapps] and none of them displayed a prominent link to contact support. Either they all forgot about it or there's a specific reason --- maybe spending too much time on unqualified leads?

## Conclusion

All in all, this is a great sales page! It has a couple minor problems, but nothing that couldn't be improved with some patient testing.

__Key takeaway:__ Customer testimonials are great. Use them to support your pitch.

[^loginpage]: You'd be surprised by the number of webapps that forget this.
[^abtests]: Of course, they've probably A/B tested a bunch of quotes and this one came out ahead, but still.
[^unread]: Especially the bit about marking emails as unread. I do this all the time!
[^saaswebapps]: [Freshdesk](http://freshdesk.com/), [Front](https://frontapp.com/) and [Zendesk](http://www.zendesk.com/)
[^aboutpage]: It would be nice to have a link to a brief "About us/History of the company" page. It's important for the reader to know that this is not a fly-by-night operation. For example, 37signals/Basecamp has an awesome [about page](https://basecamp.com/about) which presents the company while resolving tons of customer objections. Litterally every paragraph deals with a separate concern a client may have.
[^gmailuse]: This also applies to using Gmail or Outlook. The hidden cost of using Outlook for a single user is probably 100$/month but it increases significantly (read: non-linearly) with the number of users.
