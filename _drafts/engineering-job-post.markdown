title: How to write a good engineering job post
---
job posts are way more important than you think
often, there's the first thing applicants see, before even your company website
however there's no real guide to writing a good job post
everybody does their own thing
that's really frustrating because i'm sure you're missing on a ton of cool new hires because of your job post
for example, if you use a lot of very aggressive metaphors some people will be scared away from it
    example: Nylas' since-retired job post about a formula one team

so what makes a good job post?

i think it's best to learn by example so let's break down one great post (LINK)

great intro that briefly explains what the company does.

succint description of the job

requirements

wrap-up and explanations

gotchas

lots of this a reflection of company culture
if you have company culture issues, they may show up in your job posts too
even fine companies make job post mistakes though, for example:
-  biasing post toward some people
    One really useful tool to "lint" your job post is the [Kat Matfield's gender decoder](http://gender-decoder.katmatfield.com/)

- being very evasive
    you see that a lot with big companies
    they hire lots of people so they have one catch-all job post
    Maybe show Google job post?
    You're probably not Google – I suggest you spend a lot more time making your post as specific as possible

- being too specific
    you will rarely find a candidate that matches all the requirements you have.
