I spent the past afternoon wrestling with fabric, Apache, Virtualenv and PostgreSQL. 

I was going to write a long post about how Unix is old, creaky and mostly designed to be used with a text editor, when I heard about [Augeas](http://augeas.net/).
Augeas is a tool to modify UNIX config files from the commandline. It's used by a lot of projects, notably Puppet.

This is how you add an entry in /etc/hosts with augeas:

> set /files/etc/hosts/01/ipaddr 192.168.0.1

I'm not a fan of representing everything as a tree, but it beats `echo "192.168.0.1 ipaddr" >> /etc/hosts;`.


I guess I'll have to hold on this rant for another day.
