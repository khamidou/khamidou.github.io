Let's try something a little different. I've always loved picking apart great sales pages to see what makes them tick.

[Snappy](https://besnappy.com/) is a customer support webapp. It targets small to medium-sized companies. It's a page that uses customer quotes really well.

## Introduction

<img src="/images/snappy_teardown/1.png" class="img-responsive" />

This is the first thing you see about snappy. The design is quite minimalist, but there are links to all the important pages, including my favorite one, the login page.[^loginpage]

The tagline is clear and direct. It's a good idea to have a customer testimonial from the get-go --- it's always reassuring to see an app is used by real persons. This is a nitpick but the quote itself is a little too non-specific for my taste:

_"Snappy allows us to get rid of all of the problems of email"_.

Sure, email has a lot of problems, but does Snappy solve mine? The role of the first screen is to make the reader read the rest of the page. Opening with a quote about a very specific problem of email support (e.g: the number of dropped support emails before and after snappy) would make the copy much more compelling.[^abtests]

## Story

The next screen shows a small screenshot of Snappy followed by four paragraphs of sales text. It's a _very good idea_ to tease us with this image before getting to the wall of text.

<img src="/images/snappy_teardown/4.png" class="img-responsive" />

The role of this part is to make the reader realize she has a support email problem. It tells a story, which is the most important thing in sales page. The story itself is great --- I found myself nodding twice at it[^unread] --- and the outline is very clear (which is great for skimmers!). However, there's a couple things which could be better.

First, what's with the very long sentences? _"Do you remember the first time you answered a paying customerâ€™s email, quickly and courteously, with joy and even honor at the opportunity to solve a problem, delivering exactly the solution they needed, right when they needed it?"_

Long and meandering sentences like this one run out of steam quickly. Shorter phrases are easier to grasp, and pack more punch. (In this case, I would rewrite the previous sentence like this: _"Do you remember the first time you answered a customer's email? How quickly you replied --- the joy you felt about solving their problem? Do you remember how thrilled they were to see their problem solved?"_)

Second, and this is very subjective, but the parts could flow a little better. In particular, I feel like part two and three could be merged together. They're about the same thing after all.

I don't want to come off as saying that this page is bad. It has got a lot of things right, it's just not all the way there.

The next part is _brillant_! Most sales pages would jump straight to the presentation of the product. The snappy guys chose to feature a great customer quote. **"We ain't going back"**. This is gold!

## Benefits

We get to the meat of the sales pitch with the long list of benefits Snappy brings. This is pretty much your standard list of benefits. Once again, I really like how the designers peppered customer testimonials to break the monotony.

<img src="/images/snappy_teardown/7.png" class="img-responsive" />
<img src="/images/snappy_teardown/8.png" class="img-responsive" />

Unfortunately they didn't follow their idea all the way through: they've got a great quote about how easy it is to set up Snappy, but it floats at the bottom of the page instead of supporting the main pitch:

## Pricing grid

The next section is the pricing grid. I really like how their design reminds the reader of the hidden cost of using Gmail for support. It's a great way to make choosing Snappy obvious.

One weird thing with this pricing model is that they're charging the same flat-rate per seat whatever the number of users. Surely the usefulness of Snappy increases with the number of support persons, which implies higher prices?

## Wrap-up

The page wraps things up quickly by presenting the team, showing one last testimonial and suggesting taking the product tour.

It would be awesome to have a link to talk to support directly --- this a helpdesk solution after all. I looked at a few other helpdesk webapps[^saaswebapps] and none of them displayed a prominent link to contact support. Either they all forgot about it or there's a specific reason --- maybe spending too much time on unqualified leads?

## Conclusion

All in all, this is a great sales page! It has a couple minor problems, but nothing that couldn't be improved with some patient testing.

__Key takeaway:__ Customer testimonials are great. Use them to support your pitch.

<hr>

[^loginpage]: You'd be surprised by the number of webapps that forget this.
[^abtests]: Of course, they've probably A/B tested a bunch of quotes and this one came out ahead, but still.

    I also have a very personal nitpick: there's no link to Grant's company. I understand the rationale --- you don't want people to leave your sales page before you've had the time to pitch them. It's annoying for compulsive readers like me though (arguably a very small part of the population). This too has probably been A/B tested a lot.

[^unread]: Especially the bit about marking emails as unread. I do this all the time!
[^saaswebapps]: [Freshdesk](http://freshdesk.com/), [Front](https://frontapp.com/) and [Zendesk](http://www.zendesk.com/)
[^marcelproust]: Except if you're Marcel Proust, I guess.
