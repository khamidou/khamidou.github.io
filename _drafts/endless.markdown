Last year I interned at Microsoft to work on Xbox Music, a streaming app similar to Spotify. On my first day on the job, I received a free one year Xbox Music pass. Of course, I started to [dogfood](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogfooding) the service at home.

After some time, I realized that even though I had access to millions of songs, I was staying in the little sphere of artists I knew of. I was almost feeling overwhelmed.

I think it's because there's so much choice that it becomes mentally taxing. 

Whenever I'm on the frontpage of Xbox Music or Spotify, I'm wondering "What should I do? Listen to something I already know? Or maybe check out this trending album?". I usually end up listening to an album I've already heard a thousand times.

Do you remember this?

Winamp was a great piece of software. I also remember when my friends and me switched to iTunes. We did it mostly because our libraries were getting bigger and Winamp's simple file selector just didn't cut it. When you have more than a hundred albums you need to have an abstraction like the library.

The idea behind the library is to forget about the layout of files on the filesystem. Instead, put everything at the same place, add 
album covers and god will recognize his own.

(Eventually, Winamp introduced a library feature but by then we had moved on).

Now, with the streaming services with moved to another order of magnitude. The size of our library was limited by the size of our (already gigantic) disks, but how do you handle millions of tracks? We can't. So now there's a shift to use sophisticated algorithms to suggest music you might like.
