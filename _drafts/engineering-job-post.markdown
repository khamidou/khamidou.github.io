title: How to write a good engineering job post

Writing a good job post is one of the most overlooked parts of the process of hiring engineers. That's unfortunate because a job post is often the first contact a future hire has with your company[^website].

If you're a company looking to hire remote workers, you absolutely need a good job posting[^remote]

What's interesting is that there are almost no guides about how to write a blog post – it seems that most startups slap them together based on what everyone else does. That's why most startup job posts end up reading like an ambitious mission statement ("We want to disrupt the pizza delivery market!") followed by laundry list of requirements (Python! Javascript! Mongo! AWS!).

There's a better way to do that – and it will get you more motivated candidates. Candidates who are interested in your culture and technical challenges. This is a guide on how to do this.

# The first role of a job post is selling

The most important thing to remember when writing a job post is that you're trying to get a candidate interested in your company.

Generally[^spacex], candidates are interested by three things (in this order):

1. your company culture: Does it have work-life balance? Will my colleagues be nice? Is the company diverse?
2. opportunities for growth: If I want to lead a team, will I be able to do it in a few years? Can I do public speaking?
3. your company's mission: Is it going to make the world a better place?

That means that you're going to have to put these three things front and center. I know that this sounds easier said than done – don't worry we'll be diving into specific examples you can later use as inspiration.

# How to structure a job post

Like the best classical essays, most job posts follow a three-part structure. Generally it looks like this:
1. What the role is
2. What our requirements are
3. Why're we're cool

Other companies like to spend some time telling you how cool they are before describing the job – I'm not sure it's a great idea. People are looking for a *specific* job at your company. They're not looking for *any* job there.

For example, here's a great job post from Stripe that follows this structure to a tee (click to zoom):

<a href='/images/job_posts/stripe-web-engineer-annotated.png'>
    <img alt='stripe' src='/images/job_posts/stripe-web-engineer-annotated.png' />
</a>

Let's dive into each part to see what makes them tick.

## What the role is

I know it can be very tempting to say something like "well, on a day-to-day basis you'll be fixing bugs and implementing features. You might have to talk to customers.". One the contrary, you need to be as detailed as possible to give your reader a clear idea of the job.

Here's a great example of this, one of Nylas' engineering job posts, written by my colleague [Evan Morikawa](http://evanmorikawa.com/):

![nylas job description](/images/job_posts/nylas-job-description.png)

Obviously, Nylas is still a pretty small company so it's easier to give meaningful examples of work! However, this is also possible for a bigger company. Here's how Square does it for example: 

![square job description](/images/job_posts/square-job-description.png)

This is a pretty masterful description! On the one hand you have an introduction paragraph that shows how important the team is for the success of the company ("This work has direct impact on Square’s profitability and financial success."). On the other hand you have a detailed list of what you'll work on, as well as a couple hard problems to keep you up at night.

## What our requirements are

Lots of companies have long lists of requirements. This is far from ideal, because first, how many hard requirements do you have? Most of the things that end up on a requirements list are at best nice to have.[^bash]

However, long lists of requirements have a more pernicious effect – they can intimidate some people who would otherwise apply . [Impostor syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) is a real thing.

To make sure you're not letting anybody out, it's best to keep requirements list as short as possible. Here's a good example from Clever:

{% include image-caption.html url="/images/job_posts/clever-requirements.png"
                              caption="" %}

## Why we're cool

Finally, you need to explain why someone would join your startup over any other startup. This is certainly the most tricky part of writing a job post, since it's kind of hard to sum up what makes your company special.

One of the best ways to write a "Why we're cool" section is to sit down and write what makes the culture of your company great. This means writing down the big things (Do you have a mission? Do you value autonomy? What about work-life balance?) as well as the smaller ones (What's your open source policy? Does everybody eat lunch at their desks or do people go out together?)

Don't be afraid to get into as much detail as you want – there are hundreds of startups in the bay area using Python. There are thousands using Node. None have your unique company culture and that's what you need to put forward.

Here's a breakdown of the "Why we're cool" section of another Stripe job posting[^whatcani]. Pay attention to all the unique selling points they have:
![stripe cool description](/images/job_posts/stripe-cool.png)

This job posting hits all the notes – from the big things (the mission: increasing the GDP of the Internet) to the smaller ones (everybody having lunch together).

If you're looking for more inspiration, here's a couple more good "why we're cool" examples:

 why stripe's job 
job posts are way more important than you think
often, there's the first thing applicants see, before even your company website
however there's no real guide to writing a good job post
everybody does their own thing
that's really frustrating because i'm sure you're missing on a ton of cool new hires because of your job post
for example, if you use a lot of very aggressive metaphors some people will be scared away from it
    example: Nylas' since-retired job post about a formula one team

so what makes a good job post?

i think it's best to learn by example so let's break down one great post (LINK)

great intro that briefly explains what the company does.
    job post example

description of the job
    job post example
    -> don't hesitate to add lots of examples
    -> they have to be detailed – can't say "they chat with customers"

puts the hire first
    -> remember – you're trying to sell somebody on joining your company. What will your company bring them?

requirements
    you have to be cautious about requirements because they can be intimidating to some people
    while other people don't match them but will apply regardless

gotchas

lots of this a reflection of company culture
if you have company culture issues, they may show up in your job posts too
even fine companies make job post mistakes though, for example:
-  biasing post toward some people
    One really useful tool to "lint" your job post is the [Kat Matfield's gender decoder](http://gender-decoder.katmatfield.com/)

- being very evasive
    you see that a lot with big companies
    they hire lots of people so they have one catch-all job post
    Maybe show Google job post?
    You're probably not Google – I suggest you spend a lot more time making your post as specific as possible

- being too specific
    you will rarely find a candidate that matches all the requirements you have.  

content upgrade: my swipe file of 7 great job posts – the one which are well written and to which I always come back to.

[^remote]: I have a personal theory – remote working is becoming mainstream but right now it's the best way to find talent that is both cheaper and better than in Silicon Valley.

[^website]: Sometimes, even before your corporate website. For example, if they found your post through a job board.
[^spacex]: Obviously, the order is going to be a little different if you're, say, SpaceX. You'll get a lot more mission-driven people.
[^requirements]: Take a junior engineer for example. Do you have that many requirements, besides knowing how to code, being easy to work with and not needing too much supervision?
[^bash]: Does an SRE need to know Bash? Maybe – or maybe they can figure it out on the job.
[^copypasta]: The good news is that if you've figured out how to write it, you can just copy-paste it into all your job posts!
[^whatcani]: What can I say? They have great job postings!
