title: Setting up Kite on Digital Ocean

### Kite status report 1

<p class="meta">December 20, 2013</p>

I've had a lot more time to work on Kite since I finished my internship, so I've been able to do stuff that was in my backlog for a long time. For instance, I just added support experimental support for Digital Ocean. Here's how you can try the latest alpha version of kite on your own droplet: 

#### Creating the droplet

#### Creating the domain name

Pointing the MX DNS field to the correct machine.
Adding Domain keys

#### Deploying using Puppet

That's all folks!
