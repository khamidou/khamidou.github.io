There's an idiom in French for articles magazines publish every year, at the same time. They're called "chestnut trees"[^maronniers]. I used to read the Linux journal from time to time, and they had an issue they did every January, like clockwork: "200x: the year of the Linux desktop".

Don't you find it funny that Linux never took off on the desktop?

I remember that in the early-to-mid 2000's there was some unbriddled optimism about open source. Microsoft was knee-deep in security holes[^remember], Apple was mostly making expensive computers and IBM was pouring billions into Linux. We were going to win!

What happened?

I think a lot of developers underestimate how much external factors matter when developing software. Marketing, community management are important things to get people to use your work. Open source project are developed by volunteers, on their spare time.

There's one demographic which doesn't care much about marketing and user interface: developers. They adopted open source code because most of the time it wasn't user facing and it saved a lot of time.

That's where we are now: the whole world runs on open source software -- it's absolutely everywhere -- but all the user-facing stuff is closed source.

It makes sense to adopt open source software. Wordpress saved a lot of people from the horrors of homegrown CMSes[^CMS] but it has also partly redefined the work of developer. How many small agencies are there whose work is mostly churning out Wordpress, Drupal or Magento websites?

Economists call a product a commodity when a one product is indistinguishable from another. Rice is a commodity for example.
When you've got to pick from two freelancer who're going to develop a site based on wordpress

[^maronniers]: "maronniers".

[^compiz]: Do you remember Compiz and XGL? For a time it seemed like every distro needed to have its own 3D desktop switcher and  deformable windows.

[^remember]: Remember Win32.Blaster, Sasser and the rest? Looking back at this, it seems pretty impressive that they've turned around and now have a decent security record.

[^CMS]: [See for instance this talk by a NYTimes developer talk about their move away from their 90s, 'organic' CMS](https://speakerdeck.com/nytdevs/the-surprising-path-to-a-faster-nytimes-dot-com)
