A few years back (4 years already!) I built [Infinity Pools](/infinity-pools.html), an extension to block the constantly refreshing feeds from Facebook and Twitter. Unfortunately, after a few months, both websites changed how their refresh their feeds and the extension broke.

A couple weeks ago, I decided to take another stab at it. I've always felt it made more sense to block websites after a certain amount of time, so I decided to go with that.

After doing that, I had to decide what to put on the timeout page. I've always been a big fan of confetti and balloons animations so I started with a simple balloon animation that [I found on codepen.io](https://codepen.io/moettinger/pen/YVPzNX).

The result was pretty cool but the animation wasn't super smooth (most likely because it relies on JQuery's animation framework).

I figured it'd be a fun way to practice some animation drawing, a thing I hadn't  done since using GDI+.

Using Canvas was relatively straightforward, although the API has some strange edge cases around using Retina screens. The one strange thing that really confused me was handling rotation â€“ I was running into some weird screen tearing issues that made me not use rotations altogether, since I really didn't want to relearn college matrix algebra ðŸ˜…

Here's the final result:

Of course, you can find the source code for this extension on [Github](https://github.com/khamidou/infinity-pools/).
