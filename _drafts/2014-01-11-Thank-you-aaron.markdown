A long time ago (or at least, it feels that way), I was a freshman in college, and a LISP fanboy. 
One day, I heard that Paul Graham, the author of "On Lisp" was working on a new Lisp dialect called [Arc](http://arclanguage.org/). 
One of the example apps for Arc was Hacker News.

HNers tend to look down on redditors, and it was the case back then too. That's how I found out about reddit, and how it
got rewritten from Lisp to Python. I decided to try the language, and Aaron's framework, web.py.

Web.py was fascinating to me because it was very simple; it never got in your way. I wonder how much of Aaron went into it. Maybe a lot,maybe not all. Sadly, I'll never get to know.
 
Over the years I followed from a distance what Aaron was up to - mostly by reading his [blog](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/fullarchive) which was full of interesting ideas.

I never got to meet him but he was an inspiring person.
