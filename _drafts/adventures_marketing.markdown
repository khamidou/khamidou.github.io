About a month ago, I launched [Debuggers](http://debuggers.co), a blog about interesting bugs. The idea of the blog is to have a programmer discuss in-depth an interesting bug they've met.

I've had limited success with this website. On the one hand, I landed interesting interviews with programmers I respect a lot. On the other hand, it takes me a lot of work to get interviews. People are busy and replying to an interview email by a total stranger takes a backseat to everything else.

The other problem I have is promotion. This is what the traffic looks like:

The spikes are pretty spikey. The lows are pretty low, too.

Let's make a plan.
