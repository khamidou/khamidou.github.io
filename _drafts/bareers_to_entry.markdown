title: You probably shouldn't leave your job to work on an indie game.
---
A friend of mine always talks about leaving his job at $BIGCORP to go working fulltime on his indie game venture.

I wrote this post to try to dissuade him of doing this.

When there's a lot of demand for a product, concurrents will move-in to try to capture some of the market. If the products are very similar &mdash; economists say "undifferentiated" &mdash; there will be a pricing race to the bottom. 

This is what happened to the PC market in the late 90s. In hindsight, Microsoft's strategy in the 80s and 90s was brillant. Hardware makers have never been very good at developing software. They've never been interested in developing OSes, so they happily gave this responsibility to Microsoft.

The problem is that a Dell and a Compaq PC are essentially the same computer but with a different logo on the box. They both run Windows, so the consumer has little incentive to choose a Dell other a Compaq except price. So PC makers competed on price, until they got to the very very thin marges they have today ([about 16$ per PC sold](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jan/09/pc-value-trap-windows-chrome-hp-dell-lenovo-asus-acer)).
Essentially, in their effort to get more shares of the market, the makers all competed to sell more windows copies. 

I think there's an similar phenomenon ongoing for indie games. All the conditions are here:

1. Indie games are mostly undifferentiated products. Let's take roguelikes for instance. You can buy the following roguelikes on Steam: Spelunky, Rogue Legacy, FTL, Dungeons of Dredmor, Risk of Rain, the Binding of Isaac, Teleglitch, the Pit. 

    Average price of my very unscientific sample: __10.99$__.
2. The concurrence is fiercest than ever since it's easier than ever to make a game and get it sold. 

There's two reasons why we the game prices on Steam haven't tanked yet:
- 

**Key takeaway: Don't leave your job to become a fulltime indie developer.**

[^pcmarket]: More recently, the same thing happened to the app store and the android market.

[^devartists]: 
    It's easier to develop a game today because:

    - there's been huge productivity improvements, partly because of Moore's law (we can get away with being sloppy most of the time), partly because there's a lot of libraries available which remove the tedium of developing a game engine.
    - a lot of indie developers are hobbyists, so they don't get paid for working on the game.

    Just like a lot of web development now involves adding features to wordpress, I think a lot of the programming in games in the coming years will be about adding features to Unity/UDK/your favorite engine. This is good news for artists and generalists, but not so much for engine devs.

[^barn]: They also have an incentive to not accept games into the store too quickly, otherwise we would see a terrible drop in the prices of games.
