[Rands in repose](http://randsinrepose.com/) has an interesting [article](http://randsinrepose.com/archives/tool-cruft/) about becoming too attached to one's tools.

> No. I’m not saying that your love of an ancient editor is going to suddenly make you irrelevant… what I’m talking about is a state of mind. A crufty tool is a sign that the nimble thinking that made you a great engineer in the first place is fading. Yes, you need familiar tools to your job and XYZ editor is a fine tool, but there are different tools out there and some of them actually might be better than yours

He's right, but on the other hand, it's hard to let go of something you've spent so much time on. It's not rare for people to have hundreds of lines of lisp in their .emacs or in their .bashrc.

The answer to this is probably using your apps with as little config as possible. Using apps with sensible defaults is important too. Sadly, spending hours finetuning your favorite app is the norm in the linux world.
