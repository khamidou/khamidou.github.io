I'm working on tiny, tiny SaaS app, as a side project, [CVEBlur](https://cveblur.com). It's an app that alerts you whenever you need to patch a component of your software stack. Basically, it watches and summarizes [CVEs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures) so you don't have to.

I was unsure about the right plans and pricing to adopt, so I thought I'd look at how successful webapps price themselves.

The two ideas at the heart of most pricing plans is that all your customers don't have the same needs and that some of them get a lot more value from your product than the rest.

A good pricing system should allows you get paid at the same level than 

# 1. Seat pricing

One of the most popular ways to price an app is seat pricing. It consists in charging an app per-user. Of course, this is not for every app --- the usefulness of your app must scale with the number of user. One good example is slack[^slacks_sales_page].

It's interesting to see that they're segmenting users too.

# 2. Feature pricing

The base idea is to have a pricing number 

# 3. Volume pricing

The last type of pricing is volume pricing. It's a favorite of commodity providers like VPS vendors. Honestly, I don't really see the appeal of this type of pricing. I guess it appeals a lot to geeks because they can then design [fancy](https://www.heroku.com/pricing) [forms](http://calculator.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) to compute your monthly usage. 


[^plans]: My goal it is to be able to run it on 30 minutes a day. I know it's ambitious, so we'll see how it turns out in a few months.
[^slacks_sales_page]:
    By the way, I really like the way slack's pricing page is structure. I especially like how they position themselves: <br><br> <img alt="slack pricing" class="img-responsive" src="/images/saas_pricing/slack_sales.png" />
[^segmentation]: Marketers also call this segmentation.
