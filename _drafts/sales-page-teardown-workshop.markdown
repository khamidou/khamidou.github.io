Ah the life of the beginning freelancer. Landing contracts. Writing code. Arguing with cheap clients. Looking for contracts (actually spending an awful lot of time on the latter).

[Workshop](http://letsworkshop.com/) is a service which sends you ten high-quality leads every day. They've got a great sales pitch which resonated deeply with me[^feast]. Let's dive in.

## Aside: telling people what you're about

Before diving into the main body copy, let's talk about the first screen because it's **exceedingly great**. 
It's very obvious the author spent a lot of time on it.[^firstline]

Tons of web pages seem to assume that people have the patience to sit through 4 or 5 screens before deciding whether to close the page or not[^parallax]. This one doesn't --- the first screen is actually a condensed version of the sales pitch. It answers the three questions everybody asks themselves when landing on a new website:

You couldn't be clearer. The first screen has everything you need to know about the service and go on your merry way.

Bonus point for having a drawing here -- it gets the point across really well, without a lot of words.

## Body copy

Let's look at the first two paragraphs.

<img src="/images/workshop_teardown/2.png" class="img-responsive" />
<img src="/images/workshop_teardown/3.png" class="img-responsive" />

What's happening here? Two things: <u>making the reader realize she has a problem</u> and <u>selling her on a solution</u>.

### Making people realize they have a problem

The writer starts with a long paragraph about the difficulties of freelancing. He has a deep understanding of his audience it shows: he manages to articulate what makes freelancing hard --- mainly, having to run a business while all you want to do is code/design.

It brought me back to when I started doing it in college: I was inexperienced, with no idea of whatsoever of how to get clients and what's a sales pipeline. Typical issues for a beginning freelancer I guess. 

The next paragraph is really smart because it's not asking for a sale right away. Instead the author paints us the idyllic picture of a life without having to look for leads. How great would it be?

You see, one problem people have is they tend to forget about their pains. We get numb. We lose the sense of urgency. By presenting how life would be otherwise it's reminding us how it's a PITA.

when it shows the solution, it feels like a god send -> he's had the time to build rapport

### Selling them on a solution

After another paragraph showing how great life would be without having to look for leads, the writer introduces its service. This paragraph, is really, really well written. Look at it:

<img src="/images/workshop_teardown/5.png" class="img-responsive" />


It's just does so many things right! In a single paragraph, the writer:

1. Introduces the service
2. <span style='background-color: #ff99cc'>Gets a couple sales objections out of the way</span>(is it actually used by people? Will I need to get involved?)
2. <span style='background-color: #99FF99;'>Anchors the price</span>(the "it's the cost of a cup of coffee everyday" line is a bit clich√© but it's because so effective)
3. <span style='background-color: #ffff99'>Positions the service</span> "You're not buying workshop because it's cheap, you're buying it because it *works*").
     That's a really smart way to position yourself. After all, when the main alternative to your service is manually checking job boards, you can neither compete on price neither on quantity. Quality is where things are at.

One thing that could be better is qualifying customers. The page does a very good job at telling it's a service made for freelancers, however they come in all kind of stripes. Does it apply to small agencies? No idea.

## Handling customer objections

The final part of the sales page is a FAQ followed by a short testimonial. I don't have much to say about it apart from the opening sentence:

<img src="/images/workshop_teardown/7.png" class="img-responsive" />

I like it _a lot_. Having numbers like this make things reassuring. That's definitely something I'm going to reuse[^nitpick].

My only gripe is that there should be more testimonials. Sure, Ruben Gamez's testimonial is quite good and he's a celebrity of sorts in some circles but it kind of feels out of place with the rest of the page.

After all, this page is mostly for freelancers who have a hard time coming up with leads. What is more convincing: a testimonial from a freelancer just like you or one from someone who probably works fulltime on a SaaS service?

## Closing thoughts

This is a great sales page but I'm wondering a couple things about the service.


As a web developer I know that there's a lot of segmentation between skills. For example, it's unlikely for Rails developer to be able to customize your Wordpress install, or it would take her a lot of time.

An obvious choice to grow the service would be to branch into specific verticals --- having a weekly email only for Wordpress developers for example.

The problem is coming up with leads. Would it be possible to come up with 10 high-quality Rails leads a week? You'd have to ask Robert about this.


There's a limited number of leads you can send per day. That's annoying because
1. There's probably some overlap
2. People would benefit from more segmented change

[^parallax]: I'm looking at you, fancy parallax sales page.
[^sugarman]: That's the famous Sugarman quote "The purpose of the headline is to get the first sentence read. The purpose of the first sentence is to get the second sentence read." etc.
[^compulsive]:  I guess that's a good assumption with compulsive readers like me --- but don't believe that most people read every little line on their box of cereals during breakfast. 
[^feast]: I still get occasional shivers when reading the expression "feast or famine".
[^hoy]: Credits to [Amy Hoy](https://unicornfree.com/) for naming this. It's probably known as something else too.
[^testimonials]: Take a look at [Snappy](https://besnappy.com) to see a page that uses testimonials really well. I liked it so much I made a [teardown](/2015/01/06/sales-page-teardown-snappy/) of it.
[^firstline]: Take the opening line. _"I send people who need websites your way."_ <br>The wording is simple but doesn't say a lot about the leads you're getting --- what kind of budget do they have? --- so the author followed up with _"This week alone I've sent more than **$159,215 worth of work**."_. This is one example among many others.
[^nitpick]: Ok, so this is probably the nitpick of nitpicks --- and maybe my programmer brain taking over --- but I've got a hard time parsing _"There's zero risk for the first 30 days"_. Does it means there's actual risks after the first month?

    What about having instead a line like "Try it risk-free for 30 days"?
