Workshop is a service which sends you curated web development leads. As as a consultant, their sales pitch resonated deeply with me[^feast]. Let's see what make it so great.

## Introduction

The first screen is a condensed version of the sales pitch. It answers the three questions everybody asks themselves when landing on a new website:

The drawing is genius! It just conveys the idea so well, it's impressive.

It's very obvious the author spent a lot of time getting every little detail right.[^firstline]

## Main copy

The main copy follows what copywriters call the "Pain, Dream, Fix" structure.

[^compulsive]:  I guess that's a good assumption with compulsive readers like me --- but don't believe that most people read every little line on their box of cereals during breakfast. 
[^feast]: I still get occasional shivers when reading the expression "feast or famine".
[^firstline]: Take the opening line. _"I send people who need websites your way."_ <br>The wording is simple but doesn't say a lot about the leads you're getting --- what kind of budget do they have? --- so the author followed up with _"This week alone I've sent more than **$159,215 worth of work**."_
