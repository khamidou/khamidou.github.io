The other day I stumbled upon a weird sub-subculture – people making and wearing parodies shirts of popular brands. It's fascinating to see how people try to appropriate their favorite brands.

For some reason, Patagonia – one of Silicon Valley's favorite sportswear brands – is especially popular. There are literally dozens and dozens of parodies of their iconic logo floating around.

For instance, Patagucci was a short-lived[^cease] brand based on this idea:

Some fraternities have come up with their own take on the Patagonia logo:

Even Grateful Dead fans have their own tee-shirt!

And [there](/images/tee-shirts/tatooine.png) [are](/images/tee-shirts/supreme.jpg) [more](/images/tee-shirts/green.jpg)!


[^cease]: After digging around, I found out that they used to have an online store but had to close shop after receiving a Cease and Desist.The [letter](https://www.scribd.com/document/294002329/Patagonia-v-Patagucci-trademark-complaint-pdf) is an interesting read, if you're curious.
