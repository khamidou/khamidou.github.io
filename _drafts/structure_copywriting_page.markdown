title: The structure of a longform sales page
---
Call me weird but I've always loved reading longform sales pages. I guess I just like the way they gently take me by the hand. After reading through a couple dozens, I found the best pages [all](http://www.dw-secrets.com/) [have](http://zerotolaunchsystem.com/about/) [the](http://www.jstorimer.com/products/working-with-unix-processes) (this one is not technically long but it shares the same ideas) [same]() [structure]().

I remember when I was in high school, years ago, I used to study latin. I don't remember a lot from those years, apart that cicero was a badass, except for one thing. Basically, the action in a play follows three stages. A good longform copy page follows the same structure, except there's a lot less murdering involved.

The structure is __Exposition__ __Tension__ __Resolution__

## Exposition

The goal of this stage is make people realize they have a problem and that you, the writer, understand them.
You're telling a story about your reader and yourself.

Here's a couple examples. This one is from the [Ultimate Guide to Disney World Savings](http://dw-secrets.com).

Or this one[^storimer] (it's really great writing by the way. In five short sentences Jesse Storimer paints an accurate picture of the reader).

## Tension

## Resolution

**Key takeaway: Study the work of the greats.**

[^cta_buttons]: If it's best to put a CTA button at the bottom, why do some page put them at the top? Simply because some buyers are returning visitors.
