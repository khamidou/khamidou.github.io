title: A World Without RSS
---

Just a quick thought. RSS is very obviously in a bad shape. Mailing lists on the other hand are as good as ever. 

<!-- more -->

There's two reasons for this:

- RSS got its lunch eaten by alternatives who offered more (Facebook/Twitter/Reddit). Also RSS users are more sophisticated readers of the web. How many people are conscious enough of the way they read sites on the web to try to optimize it?
- Second, mailing lists are set and forget. You've got to check your inbox from time to time, which you probably already do. 


There's one takeaway from this:

__if you want to people to use your tool, make it set and forget.__
