title: The structure of a longform sales page
---
Call me weird but I've always loved reading longform sales pages. I guess I just like the way they gently take me by the hand. After reading through a couple dozens, I found the best pages [all](http://www.dw-secrets.com/) [have](http://zerotolaunchsystem.com/about/) [the]() [same]() [structure]().

I remember when I was in high school, years ago, I used to study latin. I don't remember a lot from those years, apart that cicero was a badass, but there's one thing I remember. Basically, the action in a play follows three stages. A good longform copy page follows the same structure, except there's a lot less murdering involved.

The structure is __Exposition__ __Tension__ __Resolution__

## Exposition

The goal of this stage is make people realize they have a problem and that you, the writer, understand them.
You're telling a story about your reader and yourself.

Here's a couple examples. This one is from the Ultimate Guide to Disney World Savings.

In the case of the disney ebook, you're a middle-class stay-at-home mom. You'd like to go on vacation to DisneyWorld, but, a dollar is a dollar. How do you make the most of this?

The goal of the exposition is to show the reader that the writer shares the same worldview. "I too am a white stay at home mom. You can trust me."

## Tension

## Resolution

[^cta_buttons]: If it's best to put a CTA button at the bottom, why do some page put them at the top? Simply because some buyers are returning visitors.
