title: When programmers write ebooks
---
Call me weird but I've always loved reading longform sales pages. I guess I just like the way they lead the reader to the sale. 

I've been reading through ebook landing pages and there's a thing I've noticed again and again: ebooks written by programmers have [extremely](http://createyourproglang.com/) [short](http://www.jstorimer.com/products/working-with-unix-processes) [landing](http://exceptionalruby.com/) [pages](https://www.petekeen.net/mastering-modern-payments). 

It's probably because we programmers generally don't like to brag. We'd like our products to stand on their own merits. It's a delusion though.

For example, here's how [Working with unix processes](http://www.jstorimer.com/products/working-with-unix-processes) sells itself[^pick].

Of course the subject is deeply technical, but I'm sure people would have benefitted from a little more hand-holding. Ok, there are real world concerns about spawning shell commands, what are they?

On the other hand, Here's an excerpt from the landing page of [the Ultimate Guide to Disneyworld](http://dw-secrets.com). It's an ebook written for middle-aged stay-at-home moms, and it has a great landing page. Here's how the author sells one of the many chapters of it's book (highlighting is mine):

The Disneyland ebook is a lot more upfront about the value it will bring out. It's important because there may be readers who are on the fence, or who don't understand the problem enough to make an informed choice.
 
[^pick]: By the way, I've got nothing against the author. I actually think his intro text is really really well written. Here it is: 
    <blockquote>You're a web developer. A good one. You write Rails apps in your sleep. But you skipped over some fundamentals. You feel like your foundation is lacking. This book will fill that gap.</blockquote>
    I couldn't help nodding in approval. This is really great storytelling.
