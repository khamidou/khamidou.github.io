title: The structure of a longform sales page
---
Call me weird but I've always loved reading longform sales pages. I guess I just like the way they gently take me by the hand. After reading through a couple dozens, I found the best pages [all](http://www.dw-secrets.com/) [have](http://zerotolaunchsystem.com/about/) [the](http://www.jstorimer.com/products/working-with-unix-processes) (this one is not technically long but it shares the same ideas) [same]() [structure]().

When I was in high school, years ago, I used to study latin. I don't remember a lot from these days, but this one stuck with me: the action in a classical play follows three stages. It's always the case. Ancient greeks loved consistency. 

A good longform copy page follows mostly the same structure, except it's a lot less _dramatic_[^pun].

This structure is __Exposition__ - __Tension__ - __Resolution__. In this post I'll try to explain this structure with show examples from real world ebooks.

## Exposition!

The goal of this stage is make people realize they have a problem and that you, the writer, understand them.
The best sales pages tell a story about your reader and yourself.

Here's a couple examples. This one is from the [Ultimate Guide to Disney World Savings](http://dw-secrets.com).

Or this one, from the sales page of [Working with Unix Processes](http://www.jstorimer.com/products/working-with-unix-processes) (it's a really strong opener by the way. It's only five short sentences and I could already identify myself with the person described.).

## Tension!

In this part, the writer tries to spark the enthusiasm of the reader. This is were the actual selling happens.
There's a variety of ways to do this. The most common one is simply going over the benefits of the book, while detailing how much value they will bring out:

By the way, there's a thing I've noticed with ebooks written by programmer: they rarely talk about benefits. It's always features, features, features. 

Now, I don't want to single out anyone but Jesse's ebook suffers from the same problem:

I'm sure people would have benefitted from a little more hand-holding.

## Resolution!


**Key takeaway: Study the work of the greats. Read more longform copy.**

[^pun]: Pun intended.
