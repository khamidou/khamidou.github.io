title: Endless Choices
---
Last year I interned at Microsoft to work on Xbox Music, a streaming app similar to Spotify. On my first day on the job, I received a free one year Xbox Music pass. Of course, I started to also use the service at home (after all, it's the idea behind dogfooding). Three months in, I realized that the way I listened to music changed.

I used to buy a couple CDs a month, and to listen to them intently at least twice. I bought my last CD six months ago.
Now, with access to Xbox Music I've got access to millions of songs, but I stay in the little sphere of artists I know of.
with two many choices, my brain defaults to the safe one
it's because everything is put on the same equal footing, when it's not
of course there are algorithm to help us but they're thought to only help us go deeper down the rabbit hole
this competition on titles is probably a mistake
