title: The structure of a longform sales page
---
Call me weird but I've always loved reading longform sales pages. I guess I just like the way they lead the reader to the sale. 

I've been reading through ebook landing pages and there's a thing I've noticed again and again: ebooks written by programmers have [extremely](http://createyourproglang.com/) [short](http://www.jstorimer.com/products/working-with-unix-processes) [landing](http://exceptionalruby.com/) [pages](https://www.petekeen.net/mastering-modern-payments). 

It's probably because we programmers generally don't like to brag. We'd like our products to stand on their own merits. It's a delusion though.

Here's an excerpt from the landing page of [the Ultimate Guide to Disneyworld](http://dw-secrets.com). It's an ebook written for middle-aged stay-at-home moms, and it has a great landing page. Here's how the author sells one of the many chapters of it's book (highlighting is mine):

Compare with how [Working with unix processes](http://www.jstorimer.com/products/working-with-unix-processes) sells itself[^pick].

Of course the subject is deeply technical, but I'm sure people would have benefitted from a little more hand-holding. For example, there are real world concerns about spawning shell commands, ok, what are they?

What if this paragraph was rewritten like this:

> __The real world concerns of spawning shell commands and how to avoid them__
> 
> I used to fear shelling out because I was afraid of introducing security flaws. 
> In this chapter I'll show you the right way to do it.  

See, you've got a problem, you may have been creating security flaws. In this chapter I'll show you the One True Way to shell out. 

**Key takeaway: Sales is not a dirty word.**

[^pick]: By the way, I've got nothing against the author. I actually think his intro text is really really well written. Here it is: 
    <blockquote>You're a web developer. A good one. You write Rails apps in your sleep. But you skipped over some fundamentals. You feel like your foundation is lacking. This book will fill that gap.</blockquote>
    I couldn't help nodding in approval. This is really great storytelling.
