title: You probably shouldn't leave your job to work on an indie game.
---
A friend of mine always talks about leaving his job at $BIGCORP to go working fulltime on his indie game venture. I wrote this post to try to dissuade him of doing this.

This will be mostly about the economics of digital goods.

<!-- more -->
In economics, the price of a good depends of three factors: 

- its scarcity. How many sellers are there?
- its marginal cost. This is econ-speak for the cost of producing one more unit.
- its demand. Are people ready to pay a lot for it?

If there's a lot of demand for a product, concurrents will move-in to try to capture some of the market. If the products are very similar &mdash; economists say "undifferentiated" &mdash; there will be a pricing race to the bottom. This is what happened to the PC market in the late 90s.[^pcmarket] 

I think there's an similar phenomenon ongoing for video games. Here's why.

First, there's been a drop in the costs necessary to produce a game: 

- there's been huge productivity improvements, partly because of Moore's law (we can get away with being sloppy most of the time), partly because there's a lot of libraries available which remove the tedium of developing a game engine.[^devartists]
- a lot of indie developers are hobbyists, so they don't get paid for working on the game.

This has a consequence: _there's more and more video games._

Second, Steam is a digital store. This means that Valve doesn't have an inventory costs. It costs almost the same for Valve to carry 1,000  games or 10,000 games. Scarcity and marginal cost become irrelevant.

In a way, Valve has an incentive to carry _as many games as possible._

So, if you add this two facts together what do you get? Hundreds of games released. There only so much time in a day.
The traditional way to solve this has been advertising. Marketing produces differentiation. 

**Key takeaway: Don't leave your job to become a fulltime indie developer.**

[^pcmarket]: 
    In hindsight, Microsoft's strategy in the 80s and 90s was brillant. 
    Hardware makers have never been very good at developing software. They've never been interested in developing OSes, so they happily gave this responsibility to Microsoft.

    The problem is that a Dell and a Compaq PC are essentially the same computer but with a different logo on the box. They both run Windows, so the consumer has little incentive to choose a Dell other a Compaq except price. So PC makers competed on price, until they got to the very very thin marges they have today ([which are about 16$ per PC sold](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jan/09/pc-value-trap-windows-chrome-hp-dell-lenovo-asus-acer)).
    Essentially, in their effort to get more shares of the market, the makers all competed to sell more windows copies. 

    This has been a great strategy for Microsoft but it has backfired. 
    
    In an effort to increase their terribly thin margins, they've turned to cutting corners. They preinstall crapware on their computers, which in turn undermines the image of Windows, which makes people buy less Windows computers. 

[^devartists]: Just like a lot of web development now involves adding features to wordpress, I think a lot of the programming in games in the coming years will be about adding features to Unity/UDK/your favorite engine. This is good news for artists and generalists, but not so much for devs.
