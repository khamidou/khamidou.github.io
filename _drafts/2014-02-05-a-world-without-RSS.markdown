title: A World Without RSS
---

Just a quick thought. RSS is very obviously in a bad shape (I won't say it's dying because it's not. CGI scripts are a dying technology. It wouldn't be fair to compare RSS with CGI). This is in no small part due to the user mental model of RSS.

On the other hand, mailing lists are flourishing. There's two reasons for this I think:
- mailing lists are more set and forget. You've got to check your inbox from time to time, which you probably already do. For RSS, you need to install a new app, with a specific interface and a new routine. This is also why twitter and the other social networks begun displacing RSS. 
- There's a specific mindset of the RSS user. There's a need to optimize a routine, which is not for everyone. How many read more than 15 sites ?
