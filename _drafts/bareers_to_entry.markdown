title: You probably shouldn't leave your job to work on an indie game.
---
A friend of mine always talks about leaving his job at $BIGCORP to go working fulltime on his indie game venture. I wrote this post to try to dissuade him of doing this. It doesn't make economic sense to me.

After writing last week's [post](http://khamidou.com/steam-bundles-and-sales-cannibalization.html), I realized that I missed a number of things, so I thought I'd write an addendum.

This will be mostly about the economics of digital goods.

<!-- more -->
In economics, the price of a good depends of three factors: 

- its scarcity. How many sellers are there?
- its marginal cost. This is econ-speak for the cost of producing one more unit.
- its demand. Are people ready to pay a lot for it?

If there's a lot of demand for a product, concurrents will move-in to try to capture some of the market. If the products are very similar &mdash; economists say "undifferentiated" &mdash; there will be a pricing race to the bottom. This is what happened to the PC market in the late 90s.[^pcmarket] 

I think there's an similar phenomenon ongoing for video games. Here's why.

Video games, when distributed by Steam, are mostly digits. Digits have this very interesting property that it costs almost nothing to copy and store them. Scarcity and marginal costs become irrelevant. They don't influence the price of a game. What does?

When developing a game there's a flurry of fixed costs. The one which impacts the bottom-line the most is labor. But even the cost of labor has been falling. Indie gamemakers work on their own time.

Marketing produces differentiation. 

In econ-speak, commodities are undifferentiated goods. For instance, wheat is a commodity. 
Games are becoming commodities.

**Key takeaway: Don't leave your job to become a fulltime indie developer.**

[^pcmarket]: 
    In hindsight, Microsoft's strategy in the 80s and 90s was brillant. 
    Hardware makers have never been very good at developing software. They've never been interested in developing OSes, so they happily gave this responsibility to Microsoft.

    The problem is that a Dell and a Compaq PC are essentially the same computer but with a different logo on the box. They both run Windows, so the consumer has little incentive to choose a Dell other a Compaq except price. So PC makers competed on price, until they got to the very very thin marges they have today ([which are about 16$ per PC sold](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jan/09/pc-value-trap-windows-chrome-hp-dell-lenovo-asus-acer)).
    Essentially, in their effort to get more shares of the market, the makers all competed to sell more windows copies. 

    This was a great strategy for Microsoft but it has backfired. 
    
    In an effort to increase their terribly thin margins, they've turned to cutting corners. They preinstall crapware on their computers, which in turn undermines the image of Windows, which makes people buy less Windows computers.
