It's January, and it's been a year since [Aaron Swartz](http://aaronsw.com) left us. This reminded me of another programmer who 
decided to disappear one day, [why the lucky stiff](http://viewsourcecode.org/why/index.html).

Apparently, one of his last tweets was:
> programming is rather thankless. you see your works become replaced by superior works in a year. unable to run at all in a few more. 

Followed by:
> kafka would be a lot harder to get into if the trial only ran on a power pc.

There's two ideas here. The first one is that code ages. Ruby code written two years ago will probably work today. Ruby code from ten years ago will not. C code from 25 years ago may work.
The software development industry seems to change fast. But is it really the case? 

The second idea is whether code can be considered as a work of art?

The industry changes faast BUT
Are we seeing progress? 

* stuff changes fast in this industry

* What software written 20 years ago or before do we still use? Mostly, operating systems, infrastructure libraries and servers.

* Reimplementing the roue (grunt/make/do/maven/)
    
    * Why ?
        * Software is infinitely nimble - Hey, see I can rewrite it in two days, and better
        * Some software is hard though. That's why Sendmail has stuck on for so long
        * However, there's some middle ground

* How I see the future
    * Moore's law is over but we're still reaping the benefits
    * Basically that's why we've got higher level languages
    * Our languages are higer level, but our demands are too.
        * That's why software development delays are still increasing
