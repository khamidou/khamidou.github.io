I'm working on tiny, tiny SaaS app, as a side project.[^plans] I'm still unsure about the right plans and pricing, so I thought I'd look at how other successful webapps price themselves.

So far, I've found three different types of pricing.

# 1. Seat pricing

The first one is seat pricing. It seems to be extremely popular when selling to businesses. One of the better pricing pages I found was slack's[^slacks_sales_page]:

[^plans]: My goal it is to be able to run it on 30 minutes a day. I know it's ambitious, so we'll see how it turns out in a few months.
[^slacks_sales_page]:
    By the way, I really like the way slack's pricing page is structure. I especially like how they position themselves: <br><br> <img alt="slack pricing" class="img-responsive" src="/images/saas_pricing/slack_sales.png" />
