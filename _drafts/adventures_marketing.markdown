I'm not really proud of it but, a few years back I was one of those diehard-linux fans. You know the kind of guy I'm talking about. The one who spouts nonsense such as "yeah, Linux should have won on the desktop -- if only Microsoft weren't spending so much on _marketing_[^marketing]".

Since then I've gained a lot of appreciation for marketers, especially after trying to promote my own projects.

About a month ago, I launched [Debuggers](http://debuggers.co), a blog about interesting bugs. The idea of the blog is to have a programmer discuss an interesting bug they've met.

I've had limited success with this website. On the one hand, I landed interesting interviews with programmers I respect a lot. On the other hand, it takes me a lot of work to get interviews. People are busy and replying to an interview email by a total stranger takes a backseat to everything else.

The other problem I have is promotion. This is what the traffic looks like:

The spikes are pretty spikey. The lows are pretty low, too. I submit the posts to reddit and hn, where they enjoy some moderate success but the traffic dries down after a couple days.

I thought of a couple ways to address this:

#1. Getting more contributions

First, I need to get more serious about getting interviews. My current process is:

1. Find an interesting programmer
2. Write an email
3. Wait for reply

This obviously doesn't work. I've thought of two ways to get more leads. First, I feel silly because I didn't think of it before, but asking for referrals is a cool way to get new interviewees.

Second, I've been working on getting more unsolicited contributions because they're awesome. On the original site it just wasn't obvious you could contribute a story to the blog. You had to hunt my email address on the "About" page and read some uninteresting blurb about the blog. Since then I reworked the page to be more about contributing stories. I've also added a more proeminent "Contributing a story" link.

#2. Getting more traffic

I'm not looking to do extensive promotion - in my opinion great content promotes itself[^content]. However, there's some low-hanging fruit to pick up.

For example, I've got a lot of work to do on post titles. If a post doesn't have a good title, it won't get read, period. Some blogs can get away with sybilline titles ([the setup](http://usesthis.com), daring fireball), but not mine[^buzzfeed].

All in all, it's going to be less time on Google Analytics and more time writing emails.

[^marketing]: In my uneducated mind a combination of sales/marketing/corruption. It took me working at Microsoft to realize marketing wasn't really their forte, but I digress.
[^content]: At least that's what my SEO friends tell me.
[^buzzfeed]: I'm not saying I'm going to rewrite my titles as "This programmer was debugging the kernel... You won't believe what happened next".
