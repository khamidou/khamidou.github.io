                    <p>Last night something broke on a server. You got paged. After two hours of struggle you finally found that the issue was caused by a cron job which made a critical server run out of disk space. Sounds familiar? It certainly does for me.</p>
                    <p>
                        You’re not going to get those hours of sleep back. However, you can learn how to solve this kind of problems faster. Debugging production issues isn’t something only UNIX greybeards can do --- it’s a skill you can learn, and not a hard one at that. If you’ve used a web framework like Rails before, you have the required troubleshooting skills.

                    <!--
                    <p>Imagine being able to pinpoint exactly why a server is slow or being able to see what your application server is sending to nginx. All of this is doable using classic Unix tools that you can find on most servers.</p>
                    -->

                    <p>In this free 5-lesson course, you'll learn about how to debug real-world, production issues.  We’ll be going over the following topics:</p>

                        <li>Getting your ducks in a row: setting up your app for debugging</li>
                        <li>What to do when you get paged in the middle of the night</li>
                        <li>Network debugging: a whirlwind tour</li>
                        <li>Live debugging application code</li>
                        <li>Putting it all together</li>

                    <p>
                        Hey! Thanks for reading this! My name is Karim, I'm a french software engineer. I get a lot of questions from colleagues about how to debug issues on a live systems. It turns out there's not a lot of resources I could point them to, so I decided to write a short course about those. After a couple months of work, I had this mini-course!
                    </p>

                    <b>Who is this course made for?</b>
                    <p>Anybody who has to solve production issues. I assume you'll be debugging problems on Linux, but the same ideas apply if you're running another version of UNIX.</p>

                    <b>Are you trying to sell me something?</b>
                    <p>Hah, not at all! I just want to help my fellow engineer!</p>
