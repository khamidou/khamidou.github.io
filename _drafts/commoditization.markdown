title: The melancholy of the modern programmer
categories: software
---

Lately I've been thinking about what it means to be a programmer today. If, like I do, you write webapps, you're probably using open source code. And even if you don't, you're probably working on making a FOO component talk to a BAR object using the QUUX protocol.[^replace]

[^replace]: Replace FOO with COM+, BAR with MFC and QUUX with ATL -- or something else altogether, it depends of your chappel.

There's something I'd like someone else to have told me when I started. Most software is only 80% done. It's a fact of life.

The first time I automated a deployment using fabric, I just felt like I beat the system or something. I still get a little shiver when I get to deploy new code with my script.

It's funny because I've almost lost the knowledge of how to do it by hand. In essence, I've made myself redundant for a specific set of tasks. More than that, setting up a server used to be the job of the sysadmin. Now, a lot of programmers get do this themselves.

This isn't only the case for programmers and sysadmins, designers have the same problem. [You can pick up a professional looking theme for about 20$](http://themeforest.net/). At this point, the value of a good designer lies more into how they can inform a project and less into making things pretty. And the breadth of the things you have to know as a modern designer is frightening: you've got to understand design, typography, grids, HTML/CSS, accessibility, Information Architecture.

I think there's two reasons for the tremendous pressure we're seeing applied to us. 

First, open source software. It's almost become a meme that this year is the year on Linux on the desktop, and yet it's not happening. Why? I believe that's because most open source software is an 80% solution to a problem[^hobby].

Where does open source almost dominate? On servers, because it's used by people who have an extensive knowledge of computers and who are able to patch it themselves. That's why I feel there's some sort of melancholy

Second, there's this pervasive peer-pressure. You're supposed to contribute open source on your spare time (after all, [Github is your new resum√©](http://code.dblock.org/github-is-your-new-resume)). You've got to go to meetups, maybe even give talks, etc.

3. I'm seeing a ton of new "code school" popping up. A lot of them promise to make you a developer in three to six months. 

Where do we go from now?

I see two things. First, 
A long time ago, scripting languages were seen as as not really serious. They were interpreted, slow and only good at handling text.[^extent] Today, scripting languages are almost everywhere. 

[^extent]: They still are, to some extend.
[^hobby]: It's not a criticism, I understand there's only so many hours in the days and a lot of developers write open source code as a hobby.
