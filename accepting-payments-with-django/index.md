title: The bare minimum you need to know about accepting payments with Django

I've implemented payment processing for a consulting client. Here are my notes in the hope it saves some time for someone.

## Payment processors, gateways, Stripe and the rest

Paying on the Internet is very similar to using your credit card at a point-of-sale terminal. In both cases the seller (the **merchant**) is not the one who debits your bank account. This is the job of the **payment gateway**.

Most payment gateways (Authorize.net, PayBox, etc.) will deposit the money in a temporary account called a **merchant account**. Others (Stripe, PayPal, Gumroad) will deposit directly the money in your account[^aggregate_account].

The advantage of having a dedicated merchant account is that it's easier to negotiate a specific rate. But except if you have a high transaction volume, it's simpler to start with an easy to setup solution like Stripe or Paypal.

### What you need to know about PCI compliance

The *PCI Security Standards Council* is an organization whose goal is to define security standards for handling credit cards on the Internet. If you want to accept credit cards, you'll have to deal with them, one day or another.

Thankfully, since most of the time you're simply going to integrate with a vendor, you won't have an extremely long checklist of things to worry about.[^vendor]

I read the [official docs on the subject](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/PCI%20SSC%20Quick%20Reference%20Guide.pdf). Here are the highlights:

|---
|Requirement category|Translation
|-|-
|__Build and maintain a secure network__ | Use a firewall on your server network and on your dev machines.<br> Change the defaults passwords (duh).<br> Always use HTTPS for administrative access
|__Protect Cardholder data__             | Don't store cardholder data. Actually you can store this data, but the security requirements and paperwork make this not worth it.
|__Encrypt ransmission of cardholder data across open, public networks__ | Use HTTPS.   | 
|__Develop and maintain secure systems and applications__ | Maintain the systems up-to-date. <br> Stay informed of the latest security vulnerabilities (subscribing to the [Django blog](https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/) and the [Ubuntu Security notices](http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/) is a good start).<br><br> Develop secure code (easier said than done) and do code reviews and at least one annual audit. 
|__Restrict access to cardholder data by business need-to-know__ | Self-explaining. |
|__Assign a unique ID to each person with computer access__ |Have an audit-trail: specific accounts for each user, two-factor auth and VPNs if possible, hash passwords.
|__Restrict physical access to cardholder data__Â | You shouldn't store cardholder data.

## Accepting payments with Django

You've probably come to this page after seeing the [tons of different packages on Django packages](https://www.djangopackages.com/grids/g/payment-processing/). I'll cut to the chase. To me, [django-merchant](https://github.com/agiliq/merchant) is the most mature payments app if you need support for multiple providers.

If you only need to support PayPal or Stripe, [django-stripe-payments](https://github.com/eldarion/django-stripe-payments) and [django-paypal](https://github.com/spookylukey/django-paypal) are good options.

### Stripe and PayPal gotchas

It's really easy to implement payments, especially with django-merchant -- seriously, [look at how long is takes to add Stripe payments](https://django-merchant.readthedocs.org/en/latest/gateways/stripe_payment.html). However, there's some gotchas to be aware of.

#### The Paypal encrypted button

PayPal has two payments solutions. The most basic (and the one I choose) consists in inserting a PayPal button which takes the user to PayPal for payments and then redirects him to a page of your choice. The problem is the contents of the button aren't encrypted -- someone could modify it to change a 100$ charge into a 1$ charge. The solution to this is implementing button encryption.

[Here's how to do it using Django-paypal](https://github.com/spookylukey/django-paypal#using-paypal-payments-standard-with-encrypted-buttons).

## Implementing the payment form

There's a lot of usability concerns to be aware of when implementing payments. First, it's complicated to validate card numbers -- there's a lot of variations between countries. Second, it's nice to have a payment form which adapts itself to what the user entered.

[jQuery.payments](https://github.com/stripe/jquery.payment) was developed by Stripe while working on their Checkout add-on. It's a good solution if you're implementing your payment form yourself, and if you care mostly about validating fields.

I've also heard good things about [Creditcardjs](http://creditcardjs.com/) but I never tried it personally. Besides this, it seems like most of the functionality of creditcardjs is available in jQuery.Payments.[^commodity]


## Comments, remarks, complaints

You can contact me at karim @ this site's domain. I try to reply to every email I receive.

[^aggregate_account]: This is not entirely true. Payment processors like Stripe and PayPal still have a merchant account, but it's shared among all the merchants. Because of this, it takes a lot less paperwork to accept money using them than with something like Authorize.net.

[^vendor]: at least compared to a vendor. They have a specific set of requirements called PCI PA-DSS. It's long, somehow dated and absolutely necessary.
[^commodity]: This reminds me of Joel Spolsky's classic [Strategy Letter V](http://joelonsoftware.com/articles/StrategyLetterV.html). Stripes works smartly to commoditize their complements.
