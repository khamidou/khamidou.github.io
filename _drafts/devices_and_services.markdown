title: The service shift

When I was at Microsoft I got to meet Steve Ballmer. He was doing some sort of farewell tour of the various Microsoft offices around the world. 

At the end of his speech there was a small Q&A session and someone asked Steve what he wished he had done during his tenure at Microsoft. My memory is hazy about his exact reply but I remember but his answer quickly derailed about how the future was about companies who understood software was going to integreate into online services. He added Google got this, but Apple didn't (yet).

For some reason I remembered this tidbit yesterday while reading [Brent Simmons' sync diaries](http://inessential.com/vespersyncdiary). Brent is the lead developer for Vesper, a note-taking app for iOS. For the last few months, he's been sharing how we was going to implement a sync feature.
