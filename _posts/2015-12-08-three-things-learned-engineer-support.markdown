title: 3 Things I Learned as an Engineer Doing Customer Support
featured: true
---

I work at [Nylas](https://nylas.com/) as an engineer on the API team. We're still pretty small, so engineers in my team also have to handle customer support.

It's a good thing because customers get to talk directly to the person who wrote the API they're using. However, engineers often aren't trained as customer success people and may be a bit gruff[^gruff].

Here's three things I noticed after my first six months doing customer support --- hopefully it will help a fellow engineer!

### 1. Customer support is about people (I know, I know.)

Many engineers come to customer support with a problem-oriented mindset. It's very easy to start thinking of your support queue as a list of problems to solve instead of as a list of *customers* having *problems*. It's also a great way to make your customer feel like another email on the way to Inbox zero[^notmuch]

So, before jumping into troubleshooting mode, get back to your customers. Sending a simple *"I'm sorry you're having this problem! We're looking into it"* goes a long way.

### 2. Follow up follow up follow up

Solving problems is good --- following up when things take time is better. Is there a bug on your side that will take more than two days to solve? Send an update email. Is a release getting delayed because something unexpected came up? Update your customers. You get the gist --- it's **better to overcommunicate than to solve problems silently**.

### 3. Try to not ask too many questions

You'll often get vague emails like *"Your API isn't working. I'm getting an error 500"*. Your natural inclination would be to ask back what exactly isn't working.

Instead, take 5 minutes to dig through your logs. It's very possible that you'll find what's the actual problem without having to ask your customer, which will make you look like an Ã¼ber support engineer.

That's all folks!
