I recently encountered a problem with django userena : the django server was unable to serve user mugshots even though they were correctly uploaded.

This is because by default the django development server isn't configured to serve media files. I just added the following lines to my urls.py to serve them: 

*Note: You shouldn't do this in production! Instead use nginx or apache to serve this kind of file.*

{% highlight python %}
import settings

# Serve media files only in development
if settings.DEBUG:
    urlpatterns += patterns('',
        url(r'^media/(?P<path>.*)$', 'django.views.static.serve', {
            'document_root': settings.MEDIA_ROOT,
        }),
   )
else:
    print "no server is configured to serve media files. Do it now."

{% endhighlight %}
