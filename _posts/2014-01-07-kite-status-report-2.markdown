title: Kite status report 2
---

I just realized that my last status report was exactly one month ago. Well, so much for having semi-regular status reports...

Anyway! Last month was an exciting one. I'm really close to releasing Kite v0.2!
The most important features are:

- easy deployment. Deploying a fully-featured mail server is litterally one command away
- Emails are now grouped by thread.
- Partial multiple user support. There's no auth done yet, so everyone can read your email, but most of the backend works.

I'm really excited because if everything goes right, I'll be able to start dogfooding kite and to get people to, you know, start using it.
