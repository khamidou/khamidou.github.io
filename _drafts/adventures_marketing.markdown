About a month ago, I launched [Debuggers](http://debuggers.co), a blog about interesting bugs. The idea of the blog is to have a programmer discuss an interesting bug they've met.

I've had limited success with this website. On the one hand, I landed interesting interviews with programmers I respect a lot. On the other hand, it takes me a lot of work to get interviews. People are busy and replying to an interview email by a total stranger takes a backseat to everything else.

The other problem I have is promotion. This is what the traffic looks like:

The spikes are pretty spikey. The lows are pretty low, too. I submit the posts to reddit and hn, where they enjoy some moderate success but the traffic dries down to a trickle after a couple days.

I thought of a couple ways to address this:

#1. Getting more contributions

First, I need to get more serious about getting interviews. My current process is:

1. Find an interesting programmer
2. Write an email
3. Wait for reply

This obviously doesn't work. I've thought of two ways to get more leads. First, I feel silly because I didn't think of it before, but asking for referrals is a cool way to get new interviewees.

Second, I've been working on getting more unwanted contributions because they're awesome. On the original site it just wasn't obvious you could contribute a story to the blog. You had to hunt my email address on the "About" page and read some uninteresting blurb about the blog. Since then I reworked the page to be more about contributing stories and added a more proeminent "Contributing a story" link. 

I should probably rewrite the page at some point.

#2. Getting more traffic

I'm not looking to do extensive promotion - in my opinion great content promotes itself. However, looking back to it, I really should work on my post titles. "Debuggers: Russ Cox",
