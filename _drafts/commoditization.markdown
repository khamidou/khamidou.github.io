Two things.

1. The first time I automated a deployment using fabric, I just felt like I beat the system or something. I still get a little shiver when I get to deploy new code with my script. It's funny because I've almost lost the knowledge of how to do it by hand. In essence, I've made myself redundant for a specific set of tasks. More than that, setting up a server used to be the job of the sysadmin. Now, a lot of programmers get do this themselves.

2. This isn't only the case for programmers and sysadmins, designers have the same problem. [You can pick up a professional looking theme for about 20$](http://themeforest.net/). At this point, the value of a good designer lies more into how they can inform a project and less into making things pretty. And the breadth of the things you have to know as a modern designer is frightening: you've got to understand design, typography, grids, HTML/CSS, accessibility, Information Architecture.

I think there's two reasons for the tremendous pressure we're seeing applied to us. 

First, open source software. It's almost become a meme that this year is the year on Linux on the desktop, and yet it's not happening. Why? I believe that's because most open source software is an 80% solution to a problem. It's not a criticism, I understand there's only so many hours in the days and a lot of developers write open source code as a hobby. 

Where did open source almost win? Servers and embedded systems. Why? Because it's used by people who've got an extensive knowledge of the inner workings of computer and who're able to patch it themselves.

3. I'm seeing a ton of new "code school" popping up. A lot of them promise to make you a developer in three to six months. 

Where do we go from now?

I see two things. First, 
A long time ago, scripting languages were seen as as not really serious. They were interpreted, slow and only good at handling text.[^extent] Today, scripting languages are almost everywhere. 

[^extent]: They still are, to some extend.
