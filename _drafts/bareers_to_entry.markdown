title: The gatekeeper

After writing last week's [post](http://khamidou.com/steam-bundles-and-sales-cannibalization.html), I realized that I missed a number of things, so I thought I'd write an addendum.

This one will be mostly about the economics of digital goods.

<!-- more -->
The price of a good depends of three factors: 

- its scarcity. Is there a unique seller who can sell me this good?
- its demand. Are people ready to pay a lot for it?
- its marginal cost. This is econ-speak for the cost of producing one more unit.

If there's a lot of demand for a product, concurrents will move-in to try to capture some of the market. If the products are very similar &ndash; economists say "undifferentiated" &ndash; there will be a pricing race to the bottom. This is what happened to the PC market in the late 90s.[^pcmarket] 

Steam basically solves the scarcity problem.

Marketing produces differentiation. 

In econ-speak, commodities are undifferentiated goods. For instance, wheat is a commodity. 
Games are becoming commodities.

**Key takeaway: Don't leave your job to become a fulltime indie developer.**

[^pcmarket]: 
    In hindsight, Microsoft strategy in the 80s and 90s was brillant. A Dell and Compaq are essentially the same computer but with a different logo on the box. They both run Windows. There's two strategies if you want to get out of such a competitive market:

    - differentiate yourself with marketing and features
    - compete on price

    They couldn't differentiate themselves on prices and features (good marketing and R&D are extremely costly, particularly when they're not your core business), so they competed on price.

    In their effort to get more shares of the market, the makers all competed to sell more windows copies. This was a great strategy but it has backfired. PC makers now make so little profit that [Apple takes 45% of the profits in the PC market](http://www.asymco.com/2013/04/16/escaping-pcs/). In an effort to increase their terribly thin margins, they've turned to cutting corners.
    
     You can blame Microsoft for the crapware you got with your new Dell.
