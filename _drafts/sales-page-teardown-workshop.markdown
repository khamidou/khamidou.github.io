[Workshop](http://letsworkshop.com/) is a service which sends you curated web development leads. As as a consultant, their sales pitch resonated deeply with me[^feast]. Let's see what makes it so great.

## Introduction

Before diving into the main body copy, let's talk about the first screen because it's **exceedingly great**. It's very obvious the author spent a lot of time on the first screen.[^firstline]

A lot of longform sales pages rely on the strength of a single tagline to make you read the rest of the page[^sugarman]. This one doesn't --- the first screen is actually a condensed version of the sales pitch. It answers the three questions everybody asks themselves when landing on a new website:

Having a drawing here is a great idea --- it gets the point across really well, without a lot of words

## Main copy

Software engineers use design patterns
One great way to structure a sales pitch is to use a sales pattern: Pain Dream Fix[^hoy].
The copy is broken into (roughly) three parts. The first one sets the stage. Here it is:

It's great because it's really well researched. A lot of these things are problems that young, inexperienced freelancer meet. They don't have a sales pipeline yet and/or they lack the discipline to look for jobs periodically.

Who likes searching for jobs on freelance boards? It's like swimming with sharks. The

### The pitch itself

Positioning:
    The thing that rang painfully true when I read this page for the first time was the bit about searching jobs. Who likes searching for jobs on freelance boards? This service has a great positioning, between zero investment (doing the job yourself) and very expensive services (getting an agent to do the work for you). That's a really smart productized service.

Credibility & Handling objections
    A short blurb at the end of the page. This part is a bit lacking -- surely if there's hundreds of customers he could have peppered a few testimonials here and there?

Qualifying customers:
    That's a problem. The page does a very good job at telling it's a service made for freelancers/consultants, however consultants come in all kind of stripes. Does it apply to small agencies? No idea. Same thing about product tiers. The problem here is that the service is constrained by the supply they have --- it must be pretty hard to come up a with a dozen quality leads every day, in multiple segments. 

Reversing risk
    "there's zero risk for the first 30 days" ~~~> dubious. Does it means it's risky afterwards? Better have "try it risk-free for a month."

Handling objections
    "but the whole point of Workshop is that I send fewer, better leads" --> great way to position the product 



Strategic
---------
Positioning
    searching jobs on job boards or elance is a waste of time
    emotional point: feast of famine consulting "Kiss f || f goodbye"
Credibility
    a short blurb at the end of the page, among other handled objections + a nice drawing and testimonial. This part is a bit lacking -- surely if there's hundreds of customers he could have peppered a few testimonials here and there?

[^sugarman]: That's the famous Sugarman quote "The purpose of the headline is to get the first sentence read. The purpose of the first sentence is to get the second sentence read." etc.
[^compulsive]:  I guess that's a good assumption with compulsive readers like me --- but don't believe that most people read every little line on their box of cereals during breakfast. 
[^feast]: I still get occasional shivers when reading the expression "feast or famine".
[^hoy]: Credits to Amy Hoy for coming up with the concept, though it probably exists under other names.
[^firstline]: Take the opening line. _"I send people who need websites your way."_ <br>The wording is simple but doesn't say a lot about the leads you're getting --- what kind of budget do they have? --- so the author followed up with _"This week alone I've sent more than **$159,215 worth of work**."_

    The same thing applies to the design of the CTA button. See how the small balloon to the left helps resolving this sales objection?

    These are two examples among many others.
