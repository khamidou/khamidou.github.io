It's early January, and it's been a year since [Aaron Swartz](http://aaronsw.com) left us. This reminded me of another programmer who 
decided to disappear one day, [why the lucky stiff](http://viewsourcecode.org/why/index.html).

Apparently, one of his last tweets was:
> programming is rather thankless. you see your works become replaced by superior works in a year. unable to run at all in a few more. 

Followed by:
> kafka would be a lot harder to get into if the trial only ran on a power pc.

        * Some software is hard though. That's why Sendmail has stuck on for so long
        * However, there's some middle ground

* How I see the future

still use emacs, linux, etc.

what do they have in common ? they're enablers. They let people build on.
