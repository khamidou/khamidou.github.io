title: Steam, Humble Bundles and sales cannibalization (part 2)
---
After writing last week's [post](http://khamidou.com/steam-bundles-and-sales-cannibalization.html), I realized that I missed a number of things, so I thought I'd write an addendum.

This one will be mostly about the economics of digital goods.

The price of a good depends of three factors: 

- its scarcity. Is there a unique seller who can sell me this good?
- its marginal cost. This is econ-speak for the cost of producing one more unit.
- its demand. Are people ready to pay a lot for it?

If there's a lot of demand for a product, concurrents will move-in to try to capture some of the market. If the products are very similar &mdash; economists say "undifferentiated" &mdash; there will be a pricing race to the bottom. This is what happened to the PC market in the late 90s.[^pcmarket] 

Steam solves the scarcity problem. You can buy a game on Steam whenever you feel like it. The transaction is fulfilled instantly.

The marginal cost of software is 0$. Once the software is written, it costs nothing to duplicate it. There are fixed costs when developing it, but they have been falling too, for two reasons:

- huge productivity gains from using common software. Today you can write a game using Unity and have it run on PC, Mac and mobile.
- labor costs are down since there's a flood of hobbyists working on their part-time on games.

Marketing produces differentiation. 

In econ-speak, commodities are undifferentiated goods. For instance, wheat is a commodity. 
Games are becoming commodities.

**Key takeaway: Don't leave your job to become a fulltime indie developer.**

[^pcmarket]: 
    In hindsight, Microsoft's strategy in the 80s and 90s was brillant. 
    Hardware makers have never been very good at developing software. They've never been interested in developing OSes, so they happily gave this responsibility to Microsoft.

    The problem is that a Dell and a Compaq PC are essentially the same computer but with a different logo on the box. They both run Windows, so the consumer has little incentive to choose a Dell other a Compaq except price. So PC makers competed on price, until they got to the very very thin marges they have today ([which are about 16$ per PC sold](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jan/09/pc-value-trap-windows-chrome-hp-dell-lenovo-asus-acer)).
    Essentially, in their effort to get more shares of the market, the makers all competed to sell more windows copies. 

    This was a great strategy for Microsoft but it has backfired. 
    
    In an effort to increase their terribly thin margins, they've turned to cutting corners. They preinstall crapware on their computers, which in turn undermines the image of Windows, which makes people buy less Windows computers.
