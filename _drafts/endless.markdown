title: Endless Choices

Last year I interned at Microsoft to work on Xbox Music, a streaming app similar to Spotify. On my first day on the job, I received a free one year Xbox Music pass. Of course, I started to also use the service at home (after all, it's the idea behind dogfooding).

Three months in I realized that I was listening to music differently with Xbox Music.
I had access to millions of songs, but I was staying in the little sphere of artists I knew of. I was almost feeling overwhelmed.

I think it's because there's so much choice that it becomes mentally taxing. 

Whenever I'm on the frontpage of Xbox Music or Spotify, I'm wondering "What should I do? Listen to something I already know? Or maybe check out this trending album?". It just never ends.

In the presence of too much choice, the brain defaults to what it already knows.

Why? Because the UI is too _specific_. How many times do you ask yourself : "I'm going to listen to `$SPECIFIC\_ARTIST`"? Most of the time you just want to put some music on. This is what creates angst.

Do you remember this?

Winamp was a great piece of software. I also remember when me and my friends in middle school switched to iTunes. We switched mostly because our libraries where getting bigger and Winamp's simple file selector just didn't cut it. When you have more than a hundred albums you need to have an abstraction like the library.

The idea behind the library is to forget about the layout of files on the filesystem. Instead, put everything at the same place, add 
album covers and god will recognize his own.

Eventually, Winamp introduced a library feature but by then we had moved on.


Now, with the streaming services with moved to another order of magnitude. The size of our library was limited by the size of our (already gigantic) disks. 
But how do you handle millions of tracks? Spotify and Xbox Music think we still want playlists of songs, just like Winamp had in 2001. This is sad because we'd rather not have
