Ah the life of the beginning freelancer. Landing contracts. Writing code. Arguing with cheap clients. Looking for contracts (actually spending an awful lot of time on the latter).

[Workshop](http://letsworkshop.com/) is a service which sends you curated web development leads. Their sales pitch resonated deeply with me[^feast]. Let's see what makes it so great.

## Introduction

Before diving into the main body copy, let's talk about the first screen because it's **exceedingly great**. It's very obvious the author spent a lot of time on it.[^firstline]

A lot of longform sales pages rely on the strength of a single tagline to make you read the rest of the page[^sugarman]. This one doesn't --- the first screen is actually a condensed version of the sales pitch. It answers the three questions everybody asks themselves when landing on a new website:

Having a drawing here is a great idea --- it gets the point across really well, without a lot of words

## Body copy

Let's look at the first two paragraphs.

<img src="/images/workshop_teardown/2.png" class="img-responsive" />
<img src="/images/workshop_teardown/3.png" class="img-responsive" />

What's happening here?

The writer starts with a long paragraph about how hard freelance life is. It lists a number of issues that young, inexperienced freelancer have. They don't have a sales pipeline yet and/or they lack the discipline to look for jobs periodically.

it hits an emotional point "You're already working too much. You have to check important emails, fix billing issues, and put out fires in your business. Doing lead generation on top of everything sucks."

segues about how life would be otherwise
    -> wouldn't be things great without having to search for clients? What if you could find quality clients, like this?

its refreshing to see a sales page spend so much time talking about your problem instead of jumping at the solution
when it shows the solution, it feels like a god send
    -> he's had the time to build rapport

After another paragraph showing how great life would be without having to look for leads, the writer introduces its service. This paragraph, is really, really well written. Look at it:

It's just does so many things right! In a single paragraph, the writer introduces the service, handles a couple sales objections (is it actually used by people?), reminds the reader that this is not a fluff service and that they'll receive something everyday, anchors the price ("it's the cost of a cup of coffee everyday" --- the line is a bit clichÃ© but it's because it *works*) and positions the service "You're not buying workshop because it's cheap, you're buying it because it *works*")

the service itself has a great positioning
    -> not about price, about quality

after this the text details the format of a typical email --- it's a good idea to break up the long wall of text with an image, it adds variety. Besides, the comments help establishing the image of the product as a serious thing.

## Handling objections

The closing part is about handling potential sales objections. These are pretty much your standard sales objections page. One weird thing is that there's only one testimonial, and it's from a dude whose company sells software for freelancers (he could be using the service but it's not guaranteed ---- what about testimonials from actual users of the service? If the service has helped hundreds of people land work, surely there's going to be a few person to spare a teestomnial[^testimonials]?



## Closing thoughts

This is a great sales page but I'm wondering a couple things about the service. First, as a web developer I know that there's a lot of segmentation between competencies --- it's unlikely for Rails developer to be able to customize your Wordpress install, or it would take her a lot of time. An obvious choice to grow the service would be to fork it into specific verticals --- having a daily email only for Wordpress developers for example. Maybe Robert could branch off with a Wordpress-specific weekly email, to get his feet wet.


There's a limited number of leads you can send per day. That's annoying because
1. There's probably some overlap
2. People would benefit from more segmented change

### The pitch itself

Positioning:
    The thing that rang painfully true when I read this page for the first time was the bit about searching jobs. Who likes searching for jobs on freelance boards? This service has a great positioning, between zero investment (doing the job yourself) and very expensive services (getting an agent to do the work for you). That's a really smart productized service.

Credibility & Handling objections
    A short blurb at the end of the page. This part is a bit lacking -- surely if there's hundreds of customers he could have peppered a few testimonials here and there?

Qualifying customers:
    That's a problem. The page does a very good job at telling it's a service made for freelancers/consultants, however consultants come in all kind of stripes. Does it apply to small agencies? No idea. Same thing about product tiers. The problem here is that the service is constrained by the supply they have --- it must be pretty hard to come up a with a dozen quality leads every day, in multiple segments. 

Reversing risk
    "there's zero risk for the first 30 days" ~~~> dubious. Does it means it's risky afterwards? Better have "try it risk-free for a month."

Handling objections
    "but the whole point of Workshop is that I send fewer, better leads" --> great way to position the product 



Strategic
---------
Positioning
    searching jobs on job boards or elance is a waste of time
    emotional point: feast of famine consulting "Kiss f || f goodbye"
Credibility
    a short blurb at the end of the page, among other handled objections + a nice drawing and testimonial. This part is a bit lacking -- surely if there's hundreds of customers he could have peppered a few testimonials here and there?

[^sugarman]: That's the famous Sugarman quote "The purpose of the headline is to get the first sentence read. The purpose of the first sentence is to get the second sentence read." etc.
[^compulsive]:  I guess that's a good assumption with compulsive readers like me --- but don't believe that most people read every little line on their box of cereals during breakfast. 
[^feast]: I still get occasional shivers when reading the expression "feast or famine".
[^hoy]: Credits to [Amy Hoy](https://unicornfree.com/) for naming this. It's probably known as something else too.
[^testimonials]: Take a look at [Snappy](https://besnappy.com) to see a page that does great testimonials. I even made a [teardown](/2015/01/06/sales-page-teardown-snappy/) of it.
[^firstline]: Take the opening line. _"I send people who need websites your way."_ <br>The wording is simple but doesn't say a lot about the leads you're getting --- what kind of budget do they have? --- so the author followed up with _"This week alone I've sent more than **$159,215 worth of work**."_

    The same thing applies to the design of the CTA button. See how the small balloon to the left helps resolving this sales objection?

    These are two examples among many others.
